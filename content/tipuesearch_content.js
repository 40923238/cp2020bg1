The most common cases are mid-size or mini-towers, while some people, mostly gamers, still like full-sized towers. Some cases are made in a small form factor (SFF) to be easily carried for portability or to match an entertainment system like a DVD player in size. Servers are often contained in very long and narrow cases that usually range in size from one unit tall (a few inches) to two units tall (about 6-8 inches). Each of these cases provide us with a distinct layout of the motherboard they will accept. This layout is called a form factor. Larger case sizes allow for additional devices (such as hard disk drives and optical drives). The type of case will depend on the customer’s needs. \n 從外部看，幾乎所有計算機在很長一段時間內看起來都是一樣的，但是現代系統確實改變了可用機箱的大小和形狀。 最常見的情況是中型或小型塔，而有些人（大多是遊戲玩家）仍然喜歡全尺寸塔。 某些情況下，它們採用小巧的外形（SFF）製成，以便攜帶方便或與DVD播放器等娛樂系統相匹配。 服務器通常裝在非常狹長的情況下，大小通常從一個單位高（幾英寸）到兩個單位高（約6-8英寸）不等。 這些情況中的每一種都為我們提供了可接受的主板佈局。 此佈局稱為形狀因數。 較大的機箱尺寸允許使用其他設備（例如硬盤驅動器和光盤驅動器）。 案例的類型將取決於客戶的需求。 \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Tower case (塔盒) \n \n Motherboards and Processors\xa0 主板和處理器 \n Form Factor構成因素 \n \n \n The size and arrangement of the motherboard is described as the form factor. The ATX form factor is one of the most widely used form factors in contemporary computers. It has been in use since the 1990s. The ATX form factor contains a rear port cluster for its integrated ports (audio, video, sound, network, etc.). The expansion slots run parallel to the short side of the board, and the cases have a left-side case opening to support easily adding expansion cards. \n 母板的尺寸和排列方式描述為外形尺寸。 ATX規格是現代計算機中使用最廣泛的規格之一。 自1990年代以來一直在使用。 ATX外形尺寸包含一個用於集成端口（音頻，視頻，聲音，網絡等）的後端口群集。 擴展插槽平行於電路板的短邊，並且機箱的左側殼體開口可輕鬆添加擴展卡。 \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 ATX form factor motherboard ( ATX尺寸主板) \n \n The mini-ATX form factor is smaller in size than the ATX form factor, but still contains many of the ATX features, such as a rear port cluster for its integrated ports (audio, video, sound, network, etc.). The expansion slots run parallel to the short side of the board, and the cases have a left-side case opening to support easily adding expansion cards. \n 迷你ATX尺寸比ATX尺寸小，但仍包含許多ATX功能，例如用於集成端口（音頻，視頻，聲音，網絡等）的後端口群集。擴展插槽平行於電路板的短邊，並且機箱的左側殼體開口可輕鬆添加擴展卡。 \n \n As shown in the table below, there are many variations of the ATX form factor, with the main difference being the physical size of the board and the number of expansion slots. Bigger boards allow for additional expansion slots, but require a larger tower. \n 如下表所示，ATX尺寸有很多變化，主要區別是板的物理尺寸和擴展插槽的數量。 更大的板可提供額外的擴展插槽，但需要更大的塔架。 \n \n \n The ITX form factor was created in 2001. The ITX form factor itself was not very popular, but a variant called the mini-ITX became quite popular, since it also fit into ATX-style cases. It also contains a rear port cluster for its integrated ports (audio, video, sound, network, etc.). The expansion slots run parallel to the short side of the board, and the cases have a left-side case opening to support easily adding expansion cards, just like the ATX boards. Smaller variations, called pico-ITX and nano-ITX, are often used in computing appliances such as smart televisions, Internet-connected set-top devices designed to integrate with TV sets, and others. \n ITX尺寸表創建於2001年。ITX尺寸表本身並不十分流行，但是一個名為mini-ITX的變體就變得非常流行，因為它也適用於ATX風格的機殼。它還為集成端口（音頻，視頻，聲音，網絡等）包含一個後部端口集群。擴展插槽平行於板子的短邊延伸，並且外殼具有左側的外殼開口，以支持輕鬆添加擴展卡，就像ATX板一樣。較小的變體，稱為pico-ITX和nano-ITX，通常用於計算設備中，例如智能電視，旨在與電視機集成的連接互聯網的機頂盒設備等。 \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Small form factor motherboard (小型主機板) \n \n \nPower supplies 電源 Power supply units (PSUs) are required in all computer systems, since computers are designed to run on direct current (DC), but our home and office outlets only provide alternating current (AC). For a computer to run well, it requires good, clean power from the outlet to the computer’s PSU. The PSU then converts the AC input into DC output to the various subsystems of the computer at the necessary voltages. The PSU creates heat in this transformation from AC to DC. Therefore, a good power supply fan is essential to remove the heat from the PSU and computer system. A power supply is a field replaceable unit (FRU) and should be replaced — never repaired — because the capacitors will hold voltage well after the PSU has been unplugged.\n \n 所有計算機系統都需要電源單元（PSU），因為計算機被設計為以直流電（DC）運行，但是我們的家庭和辦公室插座僅提供交流電（AC）。 為了使計算機正常運行，需要從插座到計算機PSU的電源乾淨整潔。 然後，PSU將交流輸入轉換為直流輸出，並在必要的電壓下將其輸入計算機的各個子系統。 PSU在從交流到直流的轉換過程中會產生熱量。 因此，良好的電源風扇對於消除PSU和計算機系統的熱量至關重要。 電源是一個現場可更換單元（FRU），應進行更換（切勿修理），因為在拔下PSU後電容器將保持良好的電壓。 \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Computer PSU, showing a space for the fan and an electric cord input \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0( 計算機PSU，顯示風扇和電線輸入的空間) \n \n Power supplies are rated in watts, with contemporary computer systems requiring 400 watts of power or more. Every device inside the computer requires power and receives it from the PSU. Therefore, the more devices there are inside the computer, the more power that is required from the power supply. A technician should verify that the backward “UR” logo(*chart1) \xa0 appears on the power supply, since this indicates that the power supply has been properly \xa0 safety tested. When purchasing a new computer, the power supply will already have been selected based on the initial configuration of the machine, but if you are adding new components to the workstation, you will need to verify that the power supply has enough wattage to support the existing and new components. To do this, you need to determine the wattage by adding all the devices’ wattage together. If the device is measured in amps, multiply amps times voltage (A x V) to calculate the watts. Power supplies are not 100 percent efficient, nor are they rated to be 100 percent efficient. Therefore, you should always keep the total wattage under 70 percent of the rated wattage of the power supply to ensure proper computer operations. \n \n 電源的額定功率為瓦特，當代計算機系統需要400瓦特或更高的功率。計算機內部的每個設備都需要電源，並從PSU接收電源。因此，計算機中存在的設備越多，電源所需要的功率就越大。技術人員應驗證電源上是否有向後的“ UR”徽標，因為這表明電源已通過適當的安全測試。購買新計算機時，將已經根據計算機的初始配置選擇了電源，但是如果您要向工作站添加新組件，則需要驗證電源是否具有足夠的功率以支持現有電源。和新組件。為此，您需要通過將所有設備的瓦數相加來確定瓦數。如果設備以安培為單位測量，則將安培乘以電壓（A x V）以計算瓦數。電源效率不是100％，也不是額定為100％。因此，應始終將總功率保持在電源額定功率的70％以下，以確保計算機正常運行。 \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0*chart1(圖一) \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Power supply specifications (電源規格) \n \n \n \n Dual Voltage 雙電壓 \n \n Most of today’s computers are built around the world with different voltages. In the United States, power is delivered at 115–120 VAC (voltage alternating current) at 60 hertz. In Europe and Asia, the typical wall outlet provides 230–240 VAC at 50 hertz. If the power supply supports dual voltage, you need to ensure the correct setting is selected. In that situation, there should be a slider button that allows you to select the proper voltage. Slide the button to the appropriate voltage before plugging the power supply into the wall or damage to the computer can occur. \n 當今大多數計算機都是在世界各地以不同的電壓構建的。在美國，功率在60赫茲的115-120 VAC（交流電壓）下輸送。在歐洲和亞洲，典型的壁裝電源插座以50赫茲提供230-240 VAC。如果電源支持雙電壓，則需要確保選擇正確的設置。在這種情況下，應該有一個滑塊按鈕，可讓您選擇合適的電壓。在將電源插頭插入牆上之前，請將按鈕滑動至適當的電壓，否則可能會損壞計算機。 \n \n What do you think would happen if we selected the wrong voltage before plugging it in? Well, if we are in Europe and expecting 230 VAC from the wall, but set the switch to 110 VAC (the United States standard), the power supply would receive an overvoltage condition, damaging the power supply and possibly starting a fire. If instead we took a European PC, which expects 230 VAC, and plugged it into a United States electrical outlet providing 110 VAC, we would get an undervoltage condition, and the computer would not start up. \n 如果我們在插入之前選擇了錯誤的電壓，您會怎麼辦？ 好吧，如果我們在歐洲並期望牆壁有230 VAC的電壓，但將開關設置為110 VAC（美國標準），則電源將出現過壓狀況，從而損壞電源並可能引發火災。 如果取而代之的是，我們帶了一個歐洲PC，該PC期望提供230 VAC的電源，然後將其插入提供110 VAC的美國電源插座，則將出現欠壓情況，並且計算機將無法啟動。 \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Power supply port and on/off switch within a metal honeycomb mesh \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0to allow for power supply ventilation( 金屬蜂窩網內的電源端口和開/關開關可允許電源通風) \nPower Supply Connectors 電源連接器\n \n ATX 12V 2.x power supplies connect to the motherboard by way of a 24-pin cable + 4-pin/8-pin for CPU and 6- or 8-pin for PCIe video. \n ATX 12V 2.x電源通過24針電纜+ 4針/ 8針（用於CPU）和6或8針（用於PCIe視頻）連接到主板。 \n \n The purpose of a "dual-rail" PSU is to separate and limit the current through each wire to avoid overheating. \n “雙軌” PSU的目的是分離並限制通過每條電線的電流，以避免過熱。 \n \n Originally, the ATX 1.x standard required 20 pins to provide the mainboard (motherboard) power connection. ATX version 2.x expanded this to 24 pins for a standard ATX12V power supply. Many power supplies will provide a 20+4 pin cable, so that they are backward compatible with older systems. \n 最初，ATX 1.x標準需要20個引腳來提供主板（主板）電源連接。 ATX版本2.x將其擴展為24引腳，用於標準ATX12V電源。許多電源將提供20 + 4針電纜，以便它們與較早的系統向後兼容。 \n \n With the higher voltage requirements of the Pentium 4 and onward, the ATX version 2.x standard made this a 24-pin cable +4 pin (original mini-ATX or P4 connector) or an EPS12 8-pin connector. The ATX12V provides a four-wire square connector for additional motherboard power. ESP12V provides an eight-wire connector (often split into two four-wire connectors for backward compatibility) for additional CPU power. Finally, there is the AUX connector, a six-wire connector to provide older systems with extra power to the motherboard. \n 隨著奔騰4及更高版本對電壓的更高要求，ATX 2.x版標準將其設置為24針電纜+4針（原始的mini-ATX或P4連接器）或EPS12 8針連接器。 ATX12V提供一個四線方形連接器，用於增加主板電源。 ESP12V提供了一個八線連接器（為了便於向後兼容，通常分為兩個四線連接器），以提供更多的CPU電源。最後，還有AUX連接器，這是六線連接器，可為較舊的系統提供額外的電源給主板。 \n \n ATX12V version 2.x eliminated the 3.3V and 5.5V rails in favor of 12V rails due to the nature of CPU and PCIe power requirements. The ATX standards from version 2.x on have all developed to improve power delivery. The 12V \xa0 dual-rail \xa0 PSU is designed to limit over voltage situations and protect against overheating. \n 由於CPU和PCIe電源要求的特性，ATX12V 2.x版取消了3.3V和5.5V供電軌，轉而採用12V供電軌。從2.x版開始的ATX標準都已經開發出來，以改善功率輸出。 12V雙軌PSU旨在限製過壓情況並防止過熱。 \n \n \n \n \n Power Cable \n Application \n Pinouts/Voltage \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n IDE/EIDE PATA devices (HDD/ODD); \n Case Fans; PCI/PCIe Expansion cards \n requiring external power (i.e., USB, \n Firewire, Thunderbolt) \n \n \n Red (+5V), Yellow (+12V), \n Black (G), Black (G) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n SATA Devices (HDD/ODD);PCI/PCIe \n Expansion cards requiring external \n power(i.e.,USB,Firewire, Thunderbolt) \n \n \n 15-pin (+3.3 V, +5V, +12V) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n PCI Express Video Cards – 6 or 8 pins \n \n 6-pin (+12 v) (ATX12V Vers. 2.1) \n 8-pin (+12 v) (ATX12V Vers. 2.2) \n or later \n \n \n \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Power supply wires( 電源線 ) \n In addition to the motherboard needing power to function, peripherals need power to function, too. The power supply provides additional connectors for peripherals used throughout the computer system. The oldest style connector is the Molex connector and is used for PATA hard drives, PATA CD/DVD drives, and extra cooling fans. The Molex is a four-pin connector that is usually one of the largest connectors. A mini-Molex or Berg connector is a four-pin connector that is rather small and only used for floppy disk drives, specifically the 3.5-inch variant of drive. SATA devices use SATA power cables, which are 15-pin L-shaped connectors. PCIe power connectors (peripheral component interconnect express) are six-pin or eight-pin connectors that are used to provide additional power to PCIe video cards at 12 VDC. Finally, if you run out of connectors of a certain type, there are conversion cables to make a Molex into SATA, or Molex into PCIe. Additionally, there exist Y-connectors for Molex that allow a single Molex to be split into two Molex connectors. As you remember, power supplies convert AC to DC power to provide power to the devices. These connectors have either +/-3.3 VDC, +/- 5 VDC, or +/- 12 VDC. \n 除了主板需要電源才能工作之外，外圍設備也需要電源才能工作。電源為整個計算機系統中使用的外圍設備提供了附加的連接器。最古老的連接器是Molex連接器，用於PATA硬盤驅動器，PATA CD / DVD驅動器和額外的冷卻風扇。 Molex是四針連接器，通常是最大的連接器之一。微型Molex或Berg連接器是一個四針連接器，它很小，僅用於軟盤驅動器，特別是3.5英寸驅動器。 SATA設備使用SATA電源線，該電源線是15針L形連接器。 PCIe電源連接器（外圍組件互連Express）是六針或八針連接器，用於為12 VDC的PCIe視頻卡提供額外的電源。最後，如果您用完了某種類型的連接器，也可以使用轉換電纜將Molex轉換為SATA，或將Molex轉換為PCIe。此外，還存在用於Molex的Y型連接器，該連接器可將單個Molex分為兩個Molex連接器。您還記得，電源將交流電轉換為直流電，以便為設備供電。這些連接器具有+/- 3.3 VDC，+ /-5 VDC或+/- 12 VDC。 \nRemove A Power Supply 卸下電源\n \n To remove the power supply, first you must power down the computer. Next, you want to verify the power switch is in the off position, and disconnect the power cord from the wall and from the machine. You can then open the case by removing the screens, and then disconnect all power supply cables from all the devices in the computer. Next, you will remove all the screws holding the PSU in place and lift or slide out the power supply from the workstation. \n 要卸下電源，首先必須關閉計算機電源。 接下來，您要確認電源開關處於關閉位置，並從牆壁和機器上拔下電源線。 然後，您可以通過卸下屏幕來打開機箱，然後從計算機中的所有設備上斷開所有電源電纜的連接。 接下來，您將卸下所有將PSU固定到位的螺釘，並從工作站上提起或滑出電源。 \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Power supply unit (供電單元) \n Replace A Power Supply 更換電源 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n To replace a PSU, you would need to verify the proper wattage for the new power supply and slide the power supply into the case. You then need to screw the power supply into place and connect all the power supply cables to the various internal components. Next, you should check the voltage setting and make sure it is set to 110 VAC for North America or 230 VAC for European/Asian countries. Connect your power cord to the power supply and turn on the computer. If the computer works properly, you can then close the case and secure the enclosure with screws. \n 要更換PSU，您需要驗證新電源的正確功率，並將電源滑入機箱。 然後，您需要將電源固定到位，並將所有電源電纜連接到各種內部組件。 接下來，您應該檢查電壓設置，並確保將其設置為北美的110 VAC或歐洲/亞洲國家的230 VAC。 將電源線連接到電源，然後打開計算機。 如果計算機正常運行，則可以合上機箱並用螺釘固定機箱。 \n Test A Power Supply 測試電源 \n In order to test a PSU, you can use either a multimeter or a power supply tester. While a multimeter would work, you must be able to know the exact pinout for each type of connector and the amount of voltage to expect from each pin. Instead, it is much simpler to buy one of many different computer power supply testers on the market today. Small LEDs light up to let you know if the power feeds are working correctly. The motherboard power tester also beeps to let you know it is receiving the correct amount of power. This device is a must for anyone who wants to be able to test power supplies quickly and easily. To use it, simply hook up the motherboard power connector (20+4 connector) to the right side of the tester. Next, hook up the power connector for the device (SATA, Molex, Berg, etc.) to the left hand side of the tester. The lights will show up green if you are receiving the proper voltages (3, 5, 12 VDC). \n 為了測試PSU，可以使用萬用表或電源測試儀。 儘管萬用表可以工作，但您必須能夠知道每種連接器的確切引腳排列以及每個引腳的預期電壓量。 相反，購買當今市場上許多不同的計算機電源測試儀之一要簡單得多。 小型LED會亮起，以告知電源是否正常工作。 主板電源測試儀還會發出嗶嗶聲，以通知您它正在接收正確數量的電源。 對於希望能夠快速輕鬆地測試電源的任何人來說，此設備都是必需的。 要使用它，只需將主板電源連接器（20 + 4連接器）連接到測試儀的右側即可。 接下來，連接設備的電源連接器（SATA，Molex，Berg等。 ）到測試儀的左側。 如果您接受適當的電壓（3、5、12 VDC），則指示燈將呈綠色亮起。 \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Power supply tester (電源測試儀) \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'PCH4 Cases Form Factors and Power Supplies 外殼外形尺寸和電源.html'}, {'title': 'PCH7\xa0Expansion Cards Audio Video and Storage 擴充卡 音頻 視頻和存儲 1', 'text': 'Overview概述 \n \n In this lesson, we will be going deeper into the expansion cards that can be plugged into motherboards. We will focus on the installation of a video card. It is important to note that the same principles for installing a video card will apply to installing any expansion card. Next, we will cover the central processing units from two major manufacturers: Intel and AMD. Finally, we will review the storage devices that our computers can use. \n 在本課程中，我們將更深入地研究可插入主板的擴展卡。我們將重點介紹視頻卡的安裝。重要的是要注意，安裝視頻卡的相同原理將適用於安裝任何擴展卡。接下來，我們將介紹兩個主要製造商的中央處理單元：英特爾和AMD。最後，我們將回顧計算機可以使用的存儲設備。\xa0 \n \n Expansion\xa0Slots\xa0 擴展插槽 \n \n \n \n Expansion cards are used to increase and expand a computer’s capability. We can add cards that perform a variety of functions, such as adding more USB, serial, or parallel ports. Communication-based cards can also expand the feature set of the computer through adding a modem or network card. Users who want to play more games may find it useful to add a new video card with better graphics capabilities. Users trying to conserve space could add a TV tuner expansion card to allow the computer to act like a TV to watch cable and record shows like a DVR. Most commonly, though, expansion slots are used to add new ports and features that were not originally available when the computer was made, such as eSATA, FireWire, or USB 3.0 ports. \n \n \n 擴充卡用於增加和擴展計算機的功能。我們可以添加執行各種功能的卡，例如添加更多USB，串行或併行端口。基於通信的卡還可以通過添加調製解調器或網卡來擴展計算機的功能集。想要玩更多遊戲的用戶可能會發現添加具有更好圖形功能的新視頻卡很有用。試圖節省空間的用戶可以添加電視調諧器擴展卡，以使計算機像電視一樣觀看電纜，並像DVR一樣錄製節目。不過，最常見的是，擴展槽用於添加新端口和新功能，例如在創建計算機時最初不可用的端口和功能，例如eSATA，FireWire或USB 3.0端口。 \n \n \n \n PCI/PCI-X Slots\xa0 PCI / PCI-X插槽 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n An expansion slot is a receptacle on the motherboard for expansion cards. The first expansion slot we will discuss is the oldest covered by the CompTIA A+ hardware exam: the peripheral component interconnect (PCI). PCI was originally developed in the early 1990s to provide an expansion slot for network, video, audio, I/O (input/output), modem, and storage host adapter cards. It replaced older technology, such as the industry standard architecture (ISA) card, as a faster and more robust expansion card slot. It was found as a 32-bit interface supporting a maximum \xa0 bus speed \xa0 of 33 MHz. Later, it also offered a 64-bit variety at a speed of 66 MHz, but even this was not fast enough for the growing demand of faster CPUs. Along came the upgrade, called PCI-X, which is a faster, 64-bit version running at a bus speed of 133 MHz. This PCI-X, which is found on modern computers that still have a PCI/PCI-X slot, is fully backward compatible with older PCI cards, but if you mix them with newer PCI-X cards, the motherboard defaults back to the slower PCI speeds. The latest version, PCI-X 2.0 supports speeds of up to 266 MHz to 533 MHz, but has been replaced by the PCIe (PCI express) card slot standards for better speed/performance. \n 擴展插槽是主板上用於擴展卡的插槽。我們將討論的第一個擴展插槽是CompTIA A +硬件考試涵蓋的最早的插槽：外圍組件互連（PCI）。PCI最初是在1990年代初開發的，旨在為網絡，視頻，音頻，I / O（輸入/輸出），調製解調器和存儲主機適配器卡提供擴展插槽。它取代了較早的技術，例如行業標準體系結構（ISA）卡，以提供更快，更強大的擴展卡插槽。發現它是支持最大 總線速度的32位接口\xa0 33 MHz。後來，它還以66 MHz的速度提供了64位版本，但是即使這樣也不夠快，無法滿足對更快CPU的不斷增長的需求。隨之而來的升級稱為PCI-X，它是一種更快的64位版本，以133 MHz的總線速度運行。該PCI-X在仍然具有PCI / PCI-X插槽的現代計算機中可以找到，與舊的PCI卡完全向後兼容，但是如果將它們與更新的PCI-X卡混合使用，則主板默認恢復為較慢的速度PCI速度。最新版本的PCI-X 2.0支持最高266 MHz至533 MHz的速度，但已被PCIe（PCI Express）卡插槽標準所取代，以實現更好的速度/性能。 \n \n PCI supports a 32- or 64-bit I/O bus providing compatibility with both 486 and Pentium machines. Here are some facts about this slot: \n PCI支持32位或64位I / O總線，從而與486和Pentium計算機兼容。以下是有關此廣告位的一些事實： \n \n \n This bus is processor independent (the CPU and the PCI bus can process concurrently).該總線獨立於處理器（CPU和PCI總線可以同時處理）。 \n \n \n \n PCI is plug-and-play, meaning that newly installed devices can be detected and configured automatically. \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 PCI是即插即用的，這意味著可以自動檢測和配置新安裝的設備。 \n \n PCI buses are most commonly used for devices such as sound cards, modems, network cards, and storage device controllers. \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0PCI總線最常用於聲卡，調製解調器，網卡和存儲設備控制器等設備。 \n \n The PCI bus is usually 32 bits wide, although 64-bit versions have been used as well.

While PCI is definitely a legacy architecture, being replaced by PCIe and Thunderbolt interfaces, it is still included on current mainboards and definitely found in service in most computer workstations. \n PCI是支持32位和64位數據路徑的I / O總線，並且自Intel 80486（1989）芯片組通過所有版本的Pentium，Apple Computers和AMD芯片組以來，一直是標準的擴展總線。儘管PCI絕對是傳統架構，已被PCIe和Thunderbolt接口取代，但它仍包含在當前主板上，並且肯定可以在大多數計算機工作站的服務中找到。 \n \n Summary\xa0 概要 \n \n \n \n \n The PCI bus runs independently of the System bus, which allows faster access times for peripheral devices using the expansion card. \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0PCI總線獨立於系統總線運行，從而可以使用擴展卡更快地訪問外圍設備。 \n \n \n PCI is PnP in both the BIOS and modern Operating Systems (WinXP +, Linux, and Apple). \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0PCI是BIOS和現代操作系統（WinXP +，Linux和Apple）中的PnP。 \n \n \n Common PCI bus expansion cards include sound cards, USB cards, Firewire cards, network cards, storage device controller (SCSI) cards, and modem cards. \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0常見的PCI總線擴展卡包括聲卡，USB卡，Firewire卡，網絡卡，存儲設備控制器（SCSI）卡和調\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0製解調器卡。 \n \n \n PCI versions originally used 32-bit and eventually 64-bit data paths with the following speeds: \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0PCI版本最初使用32位數據路徑，最終使用64位數據路徑，速度如下: \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0133\xa0MB/s (32-bit at 33\xa0MHz\xa0– the standard configuration) \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0133 MB / s（32位，33 MHz –標準配置） \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0266\xa0MB/s (32-bit at 66\xa0MHz or 64-bit at 33\xa0MHz) \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0266 MB / s（66 MHz時為32位或33 MHz時為64位） \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0533\xa0MB/s (64-bit at 66\xa0MHz)\xa0 \xa0 \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0533 MB / s（66 MHz時為64位） \n \n \n \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Expansion card (擴充卡) \n \n \n AGP Slots\xa0 AGP插槽 \n Since PCI was too slow for the newest 3D games that were becoming available in the late 1990s, a new standard port, dedicated to graphics, was needed. In 1996, the advanced graphics port (AGP) was announced and was embraced by 3D gamers for their high-speed video needs. It originally was introduced as a 1x variety, but as faster speeds were needed other varieties were added, including 2x, 4x, and 8x AGP. Each variety uses a different amount of power, as shown in the table below. \n 由於PCI對於1990年代後期推出的最新3D遊戲而言太慢了，因此需要專門用於圖形的新標準端口。1996年，高級圖形端口（AGP）正式發布，並因其對高速視頻的需求而受到3D遊戲玩家的歡迎。它最初以1x品種引入，但由於需要更快的速度，因此添加了其他品種，包括2x，4x和8x AGP。每個品種使用不同的電量，如下表所示。 \n \n \n \n AGP Card (AGP卡) \n Voltage Required (所需電壓) \n \n \n \n 1x and 2x cards (1x和2x卡) \n \n 3.3 V (3.3伏) \n \n \n 4x (4倍) \n 1.5 V (1.5伏) \n \n \n 8x (8倍) \n 1.5 V or 0.8 V (1.5 伏或0.8 伏) \n \n \n AGP Pro (AGP專業版) \n 3.3 V (3.3伏) \n \n \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0AGP card (AGP卡) \n \n AGP was dominant for a long period of time, but the introduction of PCIe (PCI express) ultimately led to a large decline in popularity, because PCIe speeds were able to outperform AGP and provide a singular slot type for all devices. \n AGP在很長一段時間內一直處於主導地位，但是PCIe（PCI Express）的引入最終導致了流行度的大幅下降，因為PCIe的速度能夠超過AGP並為所有設備提供單一的插槽類型。 \n \n Motherboards that provide AGP support have a single AGP slot. Several different versions of AGP have been implemented over the years: \n 提供AGP支持的主板有一個AGP插槽。這些年來，已經實現了AGP的幾種不同版本： \n \n \n AGP 1.0 1x: Runs at 66 MHz with a data throughput rate of 266 MBps. \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 AGP 1.0 1x：以66 MHz運行，數據吞吐率為266 MBps。 \n \n \n AGP 1.0 2x: Runs at 66 MHz with a data throughput rate of 533 MBps. \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 AGP 1.0 2x：以66 MHz運行，數據吞吐率為533 MBps。 \n \n \n AGP 2.0 4x: Runs at 66 MHz with a data throughput rate of 1066 MBps. \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 AGP 2.0 4x：以66 MHz運行，數據吞吐率為1066 MBps。 \n \n \n AGP 3.0 8x: Runs at 66 MHz with a data throughput rate of 2133 MBps. \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 AGP 3.0 8x：以66 MHz運行，數據吞吐率為2133 MBps。 \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Motherboard with AGP slot identified inside the red rectangle \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0( 帶有AGP插槽的主板在紅色矩形內標識) \n \n PCI Express (PCIe) Expansion\xa0 \xa0 Slots PCI Express（PCIe）擴展插槽 \n \n \n PCIe (PCI express) began replacing PCI, PCI-X, and AGP by 2005. Five slot sizes are available for PCIe: x1, x2, x4, x8, and x16. While x8 is an official standard, it is not very common and hard to find on both motherboards and cards. The two most common PCIe cards are the x1 and x16. PCIe x1 was designed to replace the old PCI cards for networking, modems, audio, input/output, and other needs by connecting to the southbridge. PCIe x16, on the other hand, focused on replacing AGP and PCI-X for high-speed graphics cards, and connects to the northbridge. Most motherboards support numerous types of PCIe, with several x1 and either one or two x16 card slots available. Notably, a smaller PCIe card can fit into larger PCIe slots, but not vice versa. For example, a PCIe x2 can fit into a PCIe x8, but a PCIe x8 cannot fit into a PCIe x2. \n PCIe（PCI Express）到2005年開始取代PCI，PCI-X和AGP。PCIe有五個插槽大小可供選擇：x1，x2，x4，x8和x16。雖然x8是官方標準，但它並不是很常見，很難在主板和卡上找到。兩種最常見的PCIe卡是x1和x16。PCIe x1旨在通過連接到南橋來替代用於網絡，調製解調器，音頻，輸入/輸出和其他需求的舊PCI卡。另一方面，PCIe x16專注於替換高速圖形卡的AGP和PCI-X，並連接到北橋。大多數主板支持多種類型的PCIe，具有多個x1和一個或兩個x16卡插槽。值得注意的是，較小的PCIe卡可以放入較大的PCIe插槽中，反之亦然。例如，PCIe x2可以插入PCIe x8， \n \n \n \n PCIe is considered the next generation I/O bus architecture. Rather than a shared bus, each PCIe slot links to a switch that prioritizes and routes data through a point-to-point dedicated connection and provides a serial full-duplex method of transmission. There are different versions of PCIe slots. The maximum number of lanes that can be assigned to the card inserted into the slot is based upon the card’s version. Basic PCIe provides one lane for transmission (x1), at a transfer rate of 250 MBps. It can also provide multiple transmission lanes (x2, x4, x8, x16, x32). Newer versions of PCIe can transfer data at an even higher rate per lane: \n PCIe被認為是下一代I / O總線體系結構。每個PCIe插槽（而不是共享總線）鏈接到交換機，該交換機通過點對點專用連接對數據進行優先級排序和路由，並提供串行全雙工傳輸方法。PCIe插槽有不同版本。可以為插入插槽中的卡分配的最大通道數取決於卡的版本。基本PCIe以250 MBps的傳輸速率提供一個傳輸通道（x1）。它還可以提供多個傳輸通道（x2，x4，x8，x16，x32）。較新版本的PCIe可以在每個通道上以更高的速率傳輸數據： \n \n \n PCIe Version 1: 250 MBps \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0PCIe版本1：250 MBps \n \n PCIe Version 2: 500 MBps \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0PCIe版本2：500 MBps \n \n PCIe Version 3: 1 Gbps \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0PCIe版本3：1 Gbps \n \n PCIe Version 4: 2 Gbps \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0PCIe版本4：2 Gbps \n \n PCIe cards are designated both by size and bandwidth capability. For example, a card may be identified as “single-lane (x1) PCIe with throughput up to 2 Gbps”, which would indicate this card is an x1 size card, and a version 4 card, based on its data transfer rate. Note that “Gbps” refers to “gigabits per second,” the measurement of the rate of data transfer. This should not be confused with a “GB” or “gigabyte,” which refers to the storage capacity of a device. The amount of data lanes in a connection represents the amount of bandwidth between the card and the host: more lanes equals more bandwidth. PCIe x32 cards offer maximum bandwidth, but they are rarely used because of their size. \n PCIe卡通過大小和帶寬功能指定。 例如，基於其數據傳輸速率，可以將卡標識為“吞吐量高達2 Gbps的單通道（x1）PCIe”，這將表明該卡是x1大小的卡和版本4的卡。 請注意，“ Gbps”是指“千兆位每秒”，它是數據傳輸速率的度量。 請勿將其與“ GB”或“ GB”混淆，後者是指設備的存儲容量。 連接中的數據通道數量表示卡與主機之間的帶寬量：更多的通道等於更多的帶寬。 PCIe x32卡可提供最大帶寬，但是由於其尺寸而很少使用。 \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 PCI slots ( PCI插槽 ) \n \n \n In addition to greatly increased speed, PCIe offers higher-quality service. PCIe is backwards compatible and allows legacy PCI technology to be run in the same system (i.e. you can have both PCIe and PCI buses in the same system). PCIe buses are most commonly used for video cards in modern computer systems, although nearly any other device can be designed for a PCIe slot. \n 除了大大提高速度外，PCIe還提供更高質量的服務。PCIe向後兼容，並允許傳統PCI技術在同一系統中運行（即，您可以在同一系統中同時擁有PCIe和PCI總線）。PCIe總線最常用於現代計算機系統中的視頻卡，儘管幾乎任何其他設備都可以設計用於PCIe插槽。 \n \n Small form factor computers, such as laptops or micro-ATX systems, might include a mini-PCI slot. Mini-PCI devices are small cards with either 100 or 124 pins. A typical use for a mini-PCI slot is to add internal cards (such as wireless cards and cellular cards) to laptops. \n 小型計算機，例如筆記本電腦或微型ATX系統，可能包含一個微型PCI插槽。 Mini-PCI設備是具有100或124針的小型卡。 mini-PCI插槽的典型用法是向筆記本電腦添加內部卡（例如無線卡和蜂窩卡）。 \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Video graphics array PCI express slot isometric \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 ( 視頻圖形陣列PCI Express插槽等距 ) \n \n \n \n AMR And CNR Slots\xa0 \xa0 AMR和CNR插槽 \n \n \n \n \n The audio modem riser (AMR) card is a specific type of card used to fit additional cards into a compact space. In the photo below, you can see the vertical circuit board plugged into the motherboard, then a PCIe x1 card connected horizontally to it. This vertical card is a riser card. The AMR allows for analog modems and audio connectors to be used on a riser card. The communications network riser (CNR) has largely replaced the AMR, and allows for six-channel digital audio, networking functions, and other high-quality integrated audio support on a riser card. All of these riser cards are proprietary and bundled with the motherboard when originally purchased from the manufacturer. You cannot use a riser card from one manufacturer with another’s motherboard; they are not interchangeable. They were designed to allow for more expansion devices in a smaller amount of space. \n 音頻調製解調器提升板（AMR）卡是一種特殊類型的卡，用於將其他卡裝入緊湊的空間。 在下面的照片中，您可以看到垂直電路板已插入主板，然後是水平連接的PCIe x1卡。 該垂直卡是轉接卡。 AMR允許在轉接卡上使用模擬調製解調器和音頻連接器。 通信網絡Riser卡（CNR）已在很大程度上取代了AMR，並允許在Riser卡上支持六通道數字音頻，網絡功能和其他高質量的集成音頻。 最初從製造商處購買時，所有這些轉接卡都是專有的，並且與主板捆綁在一起。 您不能將一個製造商的轉接卡與另一製造商的主板一起使用； 它們是不可互換的。 \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0VIA EPIA-M910 mini-ITX board — PCIE-03 riser card \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0( 威盛EPIA-M910 mini-ITX闆卡-PCIE-03轉接卡 ) \nProcessors 處理器\n \n The central processing unit is also known as a CPU or processor. Processors come in two main architectures: 32-bit and 64-bit. We denote 32-bit processors (or applications designed for these processors) as x86. The 64-bit processors and applications are denoted as x64. You can purchase a CPU from either Intel or AMD and it could be x86 or x64, as both companies make both types. The x64 processors allow for larger file sizes, more memory, and complicated programs to run faster and more efficiently. There are three things that differentiate CPU types: 1) socket type (which CPU will fit in which socket); 2) single or multicore design; and 3) the size of its cache. While Intel and AMD are fully compatible in terms of running the Windows operating system, you must actually get the correct software for your type of CPU if you are running UNIX/Linux. \n 中央處理單元也稱為CPU或處理器。 處理器採用兩種主要架構：32位和64位。 我們將32位處理器（或為這些處理器設計的應用程序）表示為x86。 64位處理器和應用程序表示為x64。 您可以從Intel或AMD購買CPU，並且可能是x86或x64，因為兩家公司都生產這兩種類型。 x64處理器允許更大的文件大小，更多的內存以及復雜的程序，以更快，更高效地運行。 可以區分CPU類型的三件事：1）套接字類型（哪個CPU將適合哪個套接字）； 2）單核或多核設計； 3）緩存的大小。 儘管Intel和AMD在運行Windows操作系統方面完全兼容。 \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Modern processor installed on motherboard \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 ( 安裝在主板上的現代處理器) \n \n Intel has been making processors for a long time and their contemporary processors all use the land grid array (LGA) socket style. LGA uses spring-loaded “lands” that connect with the bottom of the processor and a hinged clamp mechanism to hold the processor onto the motherboard. The heat sink is then snapped into the mounting holes at the four corners of the processor socket. \n 英特爾長期以來一直在生產處理器，其現代處理器均使用陸地網格陣列（LGA）插槽樣式。 LGA使用彈簧加載的“平台”，該平台與處理器的底部連接，並通過鉸鍊式夾緊機構將處理器固定在主板上。 然後將散熱器卡入處理器插槽四個角上的安裝孔。 \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0LGA775 socket, prior to CPU installation \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 ( 在安裝CPU之前，先安裝LGA775插槽 ) \n \n Intel processors are broken into families of processors, such as the LGA 775, which contains the Pentium 4, Pentium D, Celeron, Core 2 Duo, Core 2 Quad, and Core 2 Extreme. You should be familiar with the names of the various Intel families, such as Pentium, Celeron, Core, and Sandy Bridge. If you are asked if a certain processor is Intel or AMD, you need to be able to make this determination by the name of the processor alone. All the Intel processors you are asked about in the A+ exam have something in common: two repeated digits. If you see a family name such as LGA 1156, you know it is Intel because the number “1” is repeated in the array number. LGA 1366 has a double “6.” This holds true for all the processors asked about in the A+ exam. \n 英特爾處理器分為多個處理器家族，例如LGA 775，其中包含奔騰4，奔騰D，賽揚，Core 2 Duo，Core 2 Quad和Core 2 Extreme。 您應該熟悉各種Intel系列的名稱，例如Pentium，Celeron，Core和Sandy Bridge。 如果詢問您某個處理器是Intel還是AMD，則需要能夠僅通過處理器的名稱來做出此確定。 您在A +考試中被詢問的所有英特爾處理器都有一些共同點：兩個重複的數字。 如果看到諸如LGA 1156之類的家族名稱，您就知道它是Intel，因為陣列編號中重複了數字“ 1”。 LGA 1366具有雙“ 6”。 這對於所有在A +考試中要求的處理器都適用。 \n \n Common Intel land grid arrays: \n 常見的英特爾陸地網格陣列： \n \n \n LGA 775 – Pentium 4, Pentium D, Celeron, Core 2 Duo, Core 2 Quad, Core 2 Extreme \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0LGA 775 –奔騰4，奔騰D，賽揚，Core 2 Duo，Core 2 Quad，Core 2 Extreme \n \n LGA 1366 – Core i7 9xx, Xeon series \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0LGA 1366 – Core i7 9xx，Xeon系列 \n \n LGA 1156 – Core i3, Core i5, Core i7 (not 9xx) \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0LGA 1156 –酷睿i3，酷睿i5，酷睿i7（非9xx） \n \n LGA 1155 – Sandy Bridge Core i3, Core i5, Core i7 (second-generation) \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0LGA 1155 – Sandy Bridge Core i3，Core i5，Core i7（第二代） \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Intel Celeron processor ( 英特爾賽揚處理器 ) \n AMD usually uses letters in their naming convention, except for the 940 series. Note “940” does not have double repeating digits. Therefore, you can tell it is not an Intel processor and, instead, it is an AMD processor. All the other families you need to know for the exam are listed with letters: AM2, AM2+, AM3, AM3+, and FM1. AMD also uses a different socket style called the pin grid array (PGA). The pins on the back of the CPU connect to the processor socket with a zero insertion force (ZIF) mechanism. The heat sink clips onto mounting lugs on two sides of the processor instead of the four corners used by Intel. All AMD sockets are PGA, except the “F” family. \n 除940系列外，AMD通常在其命名約定中使用字母。 注意“ 940”沒有重複的兩位數。 因此，您可以說它不是Intel處理器，而是AMD處理器。 您需要通過考試知道的所有其他其他家庭都列出了以下字母：AM2，AM2 +，AM3，AM3 +和FM1。 AMD還使用了另一種插座樣式，稱為引腳網格陣列（PGA）。 CPU背面的引腳通過零插入力（ZIF）機制連接到處理器插槽。 散熱器夾在處理器兩側的安裝凸耳上，而不是英特爾使用的四個角。 除“ F”系列外，所有AMD插槽均為PGA。 \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0AMD processors ( AMD處理器 ) \n \n Overclocking\xa0\xa0 超頻 \n \n \n \n Overclocking is the process of running a processor, component, or bus at speeds higher than normal design specifications allow. This can be configured in the BIOS of the machine, if supported. This is a very dangerous practice, since it leads to system instability that causes crashes and higher error rates. Additionally, overclocking components makes them run hotter, which can damage them and shorten their lifespan. More power is consumed in overclocking, which creates more heat, and requires more cooling. It is not recommended to overclock your machine for most users, and should never be used in production (work) machines. Overclocking is highly popular in the gaming community, and requires specialized cooling systems to be in place, such as liquid cooling. \n 超頻是指以高於正常設計規格允許的速度運行處理器，組件或總線的過程。 如果支持，可以在計算機的BIOS中進行配置。 這是非常危險的做法，因為它會導致系統不穩定，從而導致崩潰和更高的錯誤率。 此外，超頻組件會使它們運行溫度更高，這可能會損壞它們並縮短其使用壽命。 超頻會消耗更多的功率，從而產生更多的熱量並需要更多的散熱。 不建議大多數用戶對計算機進行超頻，並且切勿在生產（工作）計算機中使用該計算機。 超頻在遊戲界非常流行，並且需要使用專門的冷卻系統，例如液體冷卻。 \n \n Choosing a processor\xa0\xa0 選擇處理器 \n \n \n \n \n \n So which socket and processor is better: Intel or AMD? It depends on the user. For most users, they are fairly equivalent. But high-end gamers who like to overclock their machines tend to select AMD because it allows for more overclocking than the Intel systems. \n 那麼哪個插座和處理器更好：Intel還是AMD？ 這取決於用戶。 對於大多數用戶來說，它們是相當等效的。 但是喜歡對自己的計算機超頻的高端遊戲玩家傾向於選擇AMD，因為它比Intel系統支持更多的超頻。 \n \n CPU Cache\xa0\xa0 CPU緩存 \n \n \n \n \n The CPU is more than just the processor — it also contains cache memory. This is a very small amount of memory that provides the fastest memory available to the CPU. Most CPUs have a level 1 and level 2 cache, but some even have a level 3 cache. Because the processor operates so quickly, we want the most-frequently-used information to end up in the cache to speed up the processing. When the processor needs information, it first checks the location “closest” to it (level 1 cache). If the information is not in the level 1 cache, the CPU then checks level 2, then level 3. If the information is not in either of those cache levels, the CPU then reaches out to the system RAM (the next fastest location), and if the information is not there, the CPU then looks to the hard disk drive (the slowest location). By continually trying to find the information closer and more quickly, the processor operations are sped up. \n CPU不僅僅是處理器-它還包含高速緩存。這是非常少量的內存，可為CPU提供最快的內存。大多數CPU具有1級和2級緩存，但有些甚至具有3級緩存。由於處理器的運行速度如此之快，我們希望將最常用的信息存儲在緩存中以加快處理速度。當處理器需要信息時，它首先檢查“最近”的位置（1級高速緩存）。如果信息不在1級緩存中，則CPU將檢查2級，然後是3級。如果信息不在這兩個緩存級中的任何一個中，則CPU會到達系統RAM（下一個最快的位置），如果信息不存在，則CPU將查找硬盤驅動器（最慢的位置）。 \n \n System performance is improved through the use of cache memory, by enabling the processor to use recent memory locations (cache) rather than retrieving information from main memory. \n 通過使能處理器使用最近的內存位置（緩存），而不是從主內存中檢索信息，可以通過使用緩存來提高系統性能。 \n \n The bottom line when it comes to cache and performance — larger cache results in faster CPU performance. \n 最重要的是緩存和性能-更大的緩存可提高CPU性能。 \nVideo Displays and Video Cards 視頻顯示器和視頻卡\n \n \n \n Earlier, we mentioned the various types of expansion cards; now we are going to focus on video/graphics cards. Video cards come in many varieties, and are sold under numerous different naming conventions, like graphics cards, graphics accelerator cards, or graphics adapters. These cards are add-on cards that create the images you see on the display/monitor. They can come in a variety of expansion card types to fit into the various expansion slots, such as PCI express (PCIe) that is currently dominant, advanced graphics port (AGP), or the older PCI slots. While many low-end desktops come with an integrated graphics chip in the CPU instead of using a dedicated card, this is not suitable for 3D games or CAD/CAM (computer-aided manufacturing) workstations. Therefore, many users will opt to use an add-on graphics card, like the one displayed below, to improve their gaming performance. \n 在前面，我們提到了各種類型的擴充卡。現在我們將專注於視頻/圖形卡。視頻卡種類繁多，並以多種不同的命名約定出售，例如圖形卡，圖形加速卡或圖形適配器。這些卡是附加卡，可創建您在顯示屏/監視器上看到的圖像。它們可以有多種擴展卡類型以適合各種擴展插槽，例如當前占主導地位的PCI Express（PCIe），高級圖形端口（AGP）或較舊的PCI插槽。儘管許多低端台式機都在CPU中集成了圖形芯片，而不是使用專用卡，但這不適用於3D遊戲或CAD / CAM（計算機輔助製造）工作站。因此，許多用戶會選擇使用附加圖形卡， \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Video card ( 顯卡 ) \n \n Video cards contain a very strong processor called a graphics processing unit (GPU) which performs the extensive mathematical calculations involved in rendering the 3D images that most games require. This extensive processing creates a lot of heat. So, properly cooling the graphics card is essential. Many cards, especially lower-powered ones, will use a passive heat sink for quiet operations, or will rely on the case fans to remove the heat. Most modern graphics cards actually use dedicated cooling fans and heat shrouds for better cooling, but they are much noisier due to the fans involved, and often required external power. The image above shows an example of a video card with an enclosed shroud and active cooling fan to draw the heat away from the card. \n 視頻卡包含一個非常強大的處理器，稱為圖形處理單元（GPU），該處理器執行渲染大多數遊戲所需的3D圖像時涉及的大量數學計算。 這種廣泛的處理過程會產生大量熱量。 因此，正確冷卻圖形卡至關重要。 許多卡（尤其是功率較低的卡）將使用無源散熱器來實現安靜運行，或者依靠機箱風扇散熱。 實際上，大多數現代圖形卡都使用專用的冷卻風扇和散熱罩來更好地冷卻，但是由於涉及的風扇噪音較大，並且通常需要外部電源，因此它們的噪音更大。 上圖顯示了一個視頻卡的示例，該視頻卡帶有一個封閉的導流罩和主動冷卻風扇，可將熱量從卡中散出。 \n \n Installing video cards is very similar to installing any other expansion card. First, you must go into the BIOS and ensure the slot is enabled (AGP or PCIe x16). This may require some configuration changes, such as the AGP speed, turning off the onboard graphics chip, or adjusting the graphics memory size. Next, you will want to power off the machine, remove the power, use proper ESD precautions, and install the new expansion cards into the proper slot. Next, cable the monitor to the card, plug the computer back into the outlet, and turn on the computer. Once the computer boots into the operating system, you will need to install the device drivers to ensure the operating system can provide the best graphics available from your new card. \n 安裝視頻卡與安裝任何其他擴展卡非常相似。 首先，您必須進入BIOS並確保已啟用插槽（AGP或PCIe x16）。 這可能需要進行一些配置更改，例如AGP速度，關閉板載圖形芯片或調整圖形內存大小。 接下來，您將要關閉機器電源，斷開電源，使用適當的ESD預防措施，然後將新的擴充卡安裝到正確的插槽中。 接下來，將顯示器連接到插卡，將計算機重新插入電源插座，然後打開計算機電源。 一旦計算機啟動進入操作系統，您將需要安裝設備驅動程序，以確保操作系統可以從新卡中提供最佳圖形。 \n \n Video Output\xa0 視頻輸出 \n \n \n Video output comes in various types of connectors based on the motherboard’s chipset or the graphics card’s chipset. The standard that has been used for the past few decades is the VGA (video graphics adapter), which is a DB-15 style connector. VGA relies on providing a good-quality analog output to a traditional computer monitor. The port for this connector is the blue one on the left in the image below. \n 視頻輸出來自基於主板芯片組或圖形卡芯片組的各種類型的連接器。 過去幾十年來一直使用的標準是VGA（視頻圖形適配器），它是一種DB-15樣式的連接器。 VGA依靠向傳統的計算機顯示器提供高質量的模擬輸出。 該連接器的端口是下圖左側的藍色端口。 \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Blue VGA connector, white DVI connector, and black HDMI type A video connector \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 ( 藍色VGA接口，白色DVI接口和黑色HDMI A型視頻接口 ) \n \n The next connector port, shown in white in the middle of the photo above, is called DVI, or digital video interface. It comes in DVI-D (for digital output only), or DVI-I (for integrated output that can provide digital or analog output) varieties. A DVI-I connector can be used with an adapter to operate with a traditional VGA monitor in analog mode, as well. \n 下一個連接器端口（稱為DVI或數字視頻接口），在上方的照片中間以白色顯示。 它具有DVI-D（僅用於數字輸出）或DVI-I（用於可提供數字或模擬輸出的集成輸出）的品種。 DVI-I連接器也可以與適配器一起使用，以在模擬模式下與傳統VGA顯示器一起使用。 \n \n The third connector, shown on the right of the image, is an HDMI, or high-definition multimedia interface, connection. HDMI comes with three standard connector types: type A (standard), C (mini), and D (micro). Although there is a designation for a type B, it has not been adopted by any manufacturers at this time. Version 2.0 supports 4K UHD and HDR-enabled devices. Micro HDMI has been largely adopted by the mobile telephone market and is included on almost all current models. The special thing about HDMI is that it isn’t limited to carrying just video, but instead carries both audio and video over a single HDMI cable. HDMI is fully digital and doesn’t support analog displays. \n 圖像右側顯示的第三個連接器是HDMI或高清多媒體接口連接。 HDMI帶有三種標準連接器類型：A型（標準），C型（微型）和D型（微型）。 儘管有B型的名稱，但目前尚未被任何製造商採用。 2.0版支持支持4K UHD和HDR的設備。 微型HDMI已被移動電話市場廣泛採用，並且幾乎包含在所有當前型號中。 HDMI的特殊之處在於，它不僅限於承載視頻，還可以通過一根HDMI電纜同時傳輸音頻和視頻。 HDMI是全數字的，不支持模擬顯示。 \n \n Another connector is DisplayPort, which has two form factors, as shown in the images below. DisplayPort was designed by the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA). Mini DisplayPort was a standard announced by Apple in 2008 and adopted by VESA in 2009 to be included in version 1.2\xa0 \n 另一個連接器是DisplayPort，它具有兩種尺寸，如下圖所示。 DisplayPort由視頻電子標準協會（VESA）設計。 迷你DisplayPort是Apple在2008年發布的標準，在2009年被VESA採納，並包含在1.2版中 \n \n This makes it an ideal interface connector for laptops and mobile devices, similar to HDMI mini. It is also similar to HDMI in that it supports both video and audio with resolutions up to 3840x2160, which can support 4K UHD. DisplayPort can be found on IBM-clone (PC) machines and is gaining traction in the marketplace on mobile devices as well. \n 這使其成為筆記本電腦和移動設備的理想接口連接器，類似於HDMI mini。它也與HDMI類似，它同時支持視頻和音頻，分辨率高達3840x2160，可以支持4K UHD。DisplayPort可以在IBM克隆（PC）機器上找到，並且在移動設備市場上也越來越受歡迎。 \n \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0DisplayPort \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Mini DisplayPort (迷你 DisplayPort ) \n \n Component/RGB (red green blue) is another high-definition connector type, but provides its output in analog format and only up to 720p of resolution. This was commonly used by VCR and DVD players, to connect to television sets, but can sometimes be found on older computers as a secondary output connector. Using RCA connectors, component video actually requires three connectors to pass the video signal to the TV, each one with a different colored label of red, green, and blue. Audio signals require separate patch cords. \n Component / RGB（紅色，綠色，藍色）是另一種高清連接器類型，但以模擬格式提供其輸出，並且分辨率最高僅為720p。 VCR和DVD播放器通常使用它來連接電視機，但有時可以在較舊的計算機上找到它作為輔助輸出連接器。 使用RCA連接器，分量視頻實際上需要三個連接器才能將視頻信號傳遞到電視，每個連接器具有不同顏色的紅色，綠色和藍色標籤。 音頻信號需要單獨的跳線。 \n \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0Component/RGB ( 分量/ RGB) \n \n S-video is a very old type of connection that was originally used to connect video cameras and VCRs to televisions. They provide a resolution of up to 480p in analog signal only. They are often labeled as “TV out” on older computer systems, and are used only as a secondary display output. \n S-video是一種非常古老的連接類型，最初用於將攝像機和VCR連接到電視。 它們僅在模擬信號中提供高達480p的分辨率。 在較舊的計算機系統上，它們通常被標記為“ TV out”，並且僅用作輔助顯示輸出。 \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 S-video connection( S視頻連接 ) \n \n Finally, we have the oldest type of video interface, Composite Video. This is by far the lowest quality output of all the types we have discussed. This cable also uses RCA connectors with an output of 480p. This cable combines all the video signals over a single RCA cable, usually labeled as “video,” and the connector itself is yellow. The Composite Video cable operates in analog signal only with the audio signal separate as well. Composite differs from Component in that audio cable are bundled together with the Composite Video (Red, White, Yellow), whereas, Component uses a total of five cables (Red, Green, Blue for video and the standard Red and White for audio). 最後，我們擁有最古老的視頻界麵類型，即復合視頻。 這是迄今為止我們討論過的所有類型中質量最低的產品。 該電纜還使用輸出為480p的RCA連接器。 該電纜通過一條RCA電纜（通常標記為“視頻”）合併所有視頻信號，並且連接器本身為黃色。 複合視頻電纜僅在模擬信號和音頻信號分開的情況下工作。 Composite與Component的不同之處在於音頻電纜與Composite Video（紅色，白色，黃色）捆綁在一起，而Component總共使用了五根電纜（紅色，綠色，藍色用於視頻，標準紅色和白色用於音頻）。\xa0 \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 Composite video RCA cable connector \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 ( 複合視頻RCA電纜連接器) \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'PCH7\xa0Expansion Cards Audio Video and Storage 擴充卡 音頻 視頻和存儲 1.html'}, {'title': 'PCH7\xa0Expansion Cards Audio Video and Storage 擴充卡 音頻 視頻和存儲 2', 'text': "storage Devices Overview\xa0 \xa0存儲設備 概述\n As we discussed in a previous module, storage is one function that makes a computer a computer. So, storage devices are a critical component. Storage devices hold all of the bits and bytes that make up the data we process, photographs, music, and more. There are many different types of storage devices used with modern computers, including hard drives, optical drives, and external drives. Some computers still have legacy storage devices such as floppy disks. \n 正如我們在上一個模塊中討論的那樣，存儲是一種使計算機成為計算機的功能。因此，存儲設備是關鍵組件。存儲設備保留構成我們處理的數據，照片，音樂等的所有位和字節。現代計算機使用許多不同類型的存儲設備，包括硬盤驅動器，光盤驅動器和外部驅動器。某些計算機仍具有舊式存儲設備，例如軟盤。 \n Storage Devices:Optical Drives \xa0 存儲設備：光盤驅動器 \n Optical drives refer to any disk drive that uses optical media, such as CDs, DVDs, or Blu-ray disks. Each disk has a different storage capacity due to the different wavelength of light the laser uses to read the disk, with shorter wavelengths enabling more data to be stored in the same physical space. CDs use infrared light, which has a long wavelength. DVDs use a red laser light, a light with a medium wavelength. Blu-ray uses a blue laser light, which has the shortest wavelength. A CD can hold 700 MB of data, or 80 minutes of music, a DVD can hold 4.7 GB on a standard disc and 8.4 GB on a dual-layer disc. Blu-ray disks can hold 25 GB on a standard disk and 50 GB on a dual-layer disc. Most contemporary workstations have a DVD writer, but Blu-ray writers are becoming more common. Also, each successive technology is backward compatible with the others, therefore a Blu-ray player can also read DVDs and CDs. However, a CD or DVD player cannot read a Blu-ray. \n 光盤驅動器是指使用光盤， CD 或 DVD 或藍光光盤等任何光學介質的磁盤驅動器。由於激光讀取磁盤所使用的光波長不同，每個磁盤具有不同的存儲容量，而較短的波長使更多數據可以存儲在同一物理空間中。 CD 使用的紅外光波長很長。 DVD 使用紅色激光，即中等波長的光。藍光使用波長最短的藍色激光。 CD 可以容納 700 MB 的數據或 80 分鐘的音樂， DVD 可以在標準光盤上容納 4.7 GB ，在雙層光盤上可以容納 8.4 GB 。藍光磁盤在標準磁盤上可以容納 25 GB ，在雙層磁盤上可以容納 50 GB 。大多數當代工作站都有 DVD 刻錄機，但是藍光刻錄機正變得越來越普遍。也，每種相繼的技術都向後兼容，因此藍光播放器還可以讀取 DVD 和 CD 。但是， CD 或 DVD 播放器無法讀取藍光。 \n The different devices use different nomenclature for their capabilities. A CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, and BD-ROM (Blu-ray) all indicate that the device is a read-only memory (ROM) device. A device that is recordable only once is identified with an “R.” On a CD-R, DVD-R, DVD+R or BD-R, the contents of the disc cannot be changed after writing it the first time. The third category of devices are identified as “RW” devices, and known as write-many, write/rewrite, or erasable. This category includes CD-RW, DVD-RW, DVD+RW, DVD-RAM, and the BD-RE disc types. \n 不同的設備為其功能使用不同的命名法。 CD-ROM ， DVD-ROM 和 BD-ROM （藍光）均表示該設備是只讀存儲器（ ROM ）設備。只能記錄一次的設備用“ \xa0 R ”標識。在 CD-R ， DVD-R ， DVD + R 或 BD-R 上，第一次寫入後無法更改光盤的內容。第三類設備被標識為“ \xa0 RW ”設備，稱為多次寫入，寫入 / 重寫或可擦除。此類別包括 CD-RW ， DVD-RW ， DVD + RW ， DVD-RAM 和 BD-RE 光盤類型。 \n The speed of an optical drive is described using an “X-rating.” The original CD players could read at 1X (one times), or 150 KBps. The 1X speed is the speed at which your audio CD drive plays your favorite song. DVD players operate at 1.385 MBps (so that is the 1X speed for that type of device). Blu-ray players operate at 4.5 MBps. When buying a drive, you will see the rating listed, such as a 52X CD player, which means it operates 52 times as fast as the original 150 KBps, or 7800 KBps, which is 7.8 MBps. The 1X for each device is the equivalent to listening to a music CD, watching a DVD, or watching a Blu-ray movie in a traditional player. \n 光盤驅動器的速度用“ \xa0 X 等級”描述。原始 CD 播放器的讀取速度為 1 倍（一次）或 150 KBps 。 1X 速度是音頻 CD 驅動器播放喜歡的歌曲的速度。 DVD 播放器的運行速度為 1.385 MBps （因此，該類型設備的速度為 1 倍）。藍光播放器的運行速度為 4.5 MBps 。購買驅動器時，您會看到列出的等級，例如 52X CD 播放器，這意味著它的運行速度是原始 150 KBps 或 7800 KBps （ 7.8 MBps ）的 52 倍。每個設備的 1X 等效於在傳統播放器中聆聽音樂 CD ，觀看 DVD 或觀看藍光電影。 \n \xa0 \n Storage Devices:External Devices \xa0 存儲設備：外部設備 \n eSATA is an extension of SATA used for external devices. The port looks identical to a regular SATA port and uses the same cables as a SATA port. Using eSATA can be thought of like using an extension cord. It brings the SATA port to the external portion of the computer's case. If your computer doesn’t have an eSATA port, you can purchase eSATA host adapters that fit in an expansion slot, such as a PCIe x1 or PCIe x4. The speed of eSATA can be 3–6 Gbps, which is very comparable to USB 3.0 speeds of 5 Gbps. \n eSATA 是用於外部設備的 SATA 的擴展。該端口看起來與常規 SATA 端口相同，並且使用與 SATA 端口相同的電纜。可以認為使用 eSATA 就像使用一根延長線。它將 SATA 端口連接到計算機機箱的外部。如果您的計算機沒有 eSATA 端口，則可以購買適合擴展插槽的 eSATA 主機適配器，例如 PCIe x1 或 PCIe x4 。 eSATA 的速度可以達到 3 – 6 Gbps ，與 USB 3.0 的 5 Gbps 速度非常可比。 \n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0eSATA port (eSATA 端口 ) \n Another form of storage is the flash memory card. It is a type of memory that retains its contents without electricity and is very durable. These are commonly used in digital media players, cameras, and USB thumb drives. These cards come in an enormous variety with nearly 50 different types created, but only a few have become common. These common cards include SD, MMC, Memory Stick, and XD. Some computers have built-in readers for these cards with memory slots, but if your computer doesn’t, an external multi-slot card reader can be added by USB for about $10. \n 另一種存儲方式是閃存卡。它是一種無需通電即可保留其內容的內存，並且非常耐用。這些通常用於數字媒體播放器，相機和 USB 拇指驅動器。這些卡種類繁多，創建了將近 50 種不同的類型，但只有少數幾種很常見。這些普通卡包括 SD ， MMC ， Memory Stick 和 XD 。某些計算機為這些帶有內存插槽的卡內置讀取器，但是如果您的計算機沒有，則可以通過 USB 添加外部多插槽卡讀取器，價格約為 10 美元。 \n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Flash memory cards ( 閃存卡 ) \n USB flash drives are commonplace today and have replaced floppy disks as the removable media of choice. They are small in physical size and large in memory capability, with the ability to store 64 GB or more of data on a single “stick.” They are popular and easy to use, since they don’t require a special card reader, because the USB device has one built-in. They are often formatted with the FAT-16, FAT-32, or exFAT file system and are ready to use straight out of the box. Simply plug the device into an available USB port, the operating system recognizes it, and you can begin copying, deleting, and modifying files. \n USB 閃存驅動器在當今很普遍，並且已取代軟盤作為首選的可移動介質。它們的物理尺寸很小，內存容量也很大，能夠在單個“棒”上存儲 64 GB 或更多的數據。它們很受歡迎且易於使用，因為它們不需要特殊的讀卡器，因為 USB 設備內置了一個。它們通常使用 FAT-16 ， FAT-32 或 exFAT 文件系統進行格式化，並且可以直接使用。只需將設備插入可用的 USB 端口，操作系統即可識別它，然後您就可以開始復制，刪除和修改文件了。 \n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0USB flash drive (USB 閃存盤 ) \n \xa0 \n Storage Devices:Legacy Devices \xa0 存儲設備：舊版設備 \n Floppy disks dominated the removable storage arena until the late 1990s, and now they are nearly extinct in most organizations. While some removable USB thumb drives can store 64 GB or more of data, floppy disks usually only stored 1.44 MB of data. That means a single thumb drive can store the information from more than 60,000 floppy disks! Floppy disks used flexible magnetic media surrounded by a rigid plastic case. The most common floppy (shown in the bottom image) was the 3.5” floppy, which was named based on the diameter of the magnetic media inside the plastic case. It used to be commonplace to find a floppy disk drive on every computer, which was connected using a mini-molex or BERG power cable and a 34-pin internal IDE/PATA cable. Contemporary machines typically do not have these drives, as they have fallen out of favor with the public. If you have a need for a floppy drive, one can be purchased for less than $20 that can connect to your computer using your USB port. Windows always reserves the A:\\ and B:\\ drives for the floppy disk drive (FDD), even if your system doesn’t have one. \n 直到 1990 年代後期，軟盤一直在可移動存儲領域佔據著主導地位，現在在大多數組織中它們幾乎已經滅絕。雖然某些可移動 USB 拇指驅動器可以存儲 64 GB 或更多的數據，但是軟盤通常僅存儲 1.44 MB 的數據。這意味著一個拇指驅動器可以存儲來自 60,000 多個軟盤的信息！軟盤使用柔性磁性介質，並由剛性塑料盒包圍。最常見的軟盤（如左圖所示）是 3.5 英寸的軟盤，它是根據塑料盒內部磁性介質的直徑來命名的。過去通常在每台計算機上都找到軟盤驅動器，該軟盤驅動器是使用 minimolex 或 BERG 電源電纜以及 34 針內部 IDE / PATA 電纜連接的。現代機器通常沒有這些驅動器，因為它們已經失去了公眾的青睞。如果需要軟盤驅動器，可以用不到 20 美元的價格購買一個軟盤驅動器，它可以使用 USB 端口連接到計算機。 Windows 始終為軟盤驅動器（ FDD ）保留 A ： \\ 和 B ： \\ 驅動器，即使您的系統沒有該驅動器也是如此。 \n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 3.5-inch floppy disks (3.5 英寸軟盤 ) \n The final legacy storage device is the tape drive. Whereas FDDs are completely out of service today, tape drives are still used in some corporate environments. However, cloud computing is a natural solution to replace tape backups in enterprise environments because it not only automates the backup process but sends the data securely offsite. Tape drives were one of the first removable storage devices used to back up system data. Many home users now use external USB hard disks for this purpose, but many enterprise environments still rely on the tape drives, since they can store large amounts of data (up to 3 TB on a single tape), and can have that data easily transferred to a remote facility. Tapes can store data in native (1:1) or compressed (2:1) mode. A tape that can natively store 70 GB, in compressed mode can store 140 GB of data. Most tape drives connect via SCSI ports, but some can be found using IDE/PATA or SATA instead. Also, it is important to remember that if you are using a tape drive system, you must rotate your tapes to prevent them from getting worn out and have a good backup plan. The Tower of Hanoi is a common tape rotation system used by system administrators, and can be helpful in creating your rotational schema. \n 最終的舊式存儲設備是磁帶機。儘管 FDD 如今已完全停用，但磁帶驅動器仍在某些公司環境中使用。但是，雲計算是替換企業環境中磁帶備份的自然解決方案，因為它不僅可以自動執行備份過程，而且可以安全地將數據發送到異地。磁帶驅動器是最早用於備份系統數據的可移動存儲設備之一。現在，許多家庭用戶為此使用外部 USB 硬盤，但是許多企業環境仍然依賴於磁帶驅動器，因為它們可以存儲大量數據（單個磁帶上最多 3 TB ），並且可以輕鬆地傳輸這些數據。到遠程設施。磁帶可以本機（ 1 ： 1 ）或壓縮（ 2 ： 1 ）模式存儲數據。可以本機存儲 70 GB 的磁帶，在壓縮模式下可以存儲 140 GB 的數據。大多數磁帶機通過 SCSI 端口連接，但有些磁帶機可以使用 IDE / PATA 或 SATA 找到。同樣，重要的是要記住，如果使用的是磁帶驅動器系統，則必須旋轉磁帶以防止其磨損並製定良好的備份計劃。河內之塔是系統管理員使用的常見磁帶旋轉系統，可以幫助您創建旋轉模式。 \n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Tape drive ( 磁帶機 ) \nStorage Devices Hard Disk Drives 存儲設備 硬盤驅動器 \n Hard disk drives (HDDs) are by far the most important storage device used by a personal computer. These drives store all the user’s data files, applications, and operating systems. Whether the drive is internal or external, it is built the same way. Most drives are built from one or more double-sided platters of aluminum or glass that is coated with a magnetic surface. In the first hard drives, users were lucky to store a maximum of 5 MB of data, but now storage space of 500 GB to 3 TB is commonplace in most users’ workstations. Storage has certainly evolved into expansive storage capacities at minimal cost, with excellent performance speeds. \n 硬盤驅動器（ HDD ）是迄今為止個人計算機使用的最重要的存儲設備。這些驅動器存儲所有用戶的數據文件，應用程序和操作系統。無論驅動器是內部驅動器還是外部驅動器，其構建方式均相同。大多數驅動器是由一個或多個塗有磁性表面的鋁或玻璃雙面盤製成的。在第一個硬盤驅動器中，用戶很幸運地存儲了最多 5 MB 的數據，但是現在在大多數用戶的工作站中， 500 GB 至 3 TB 的存儲空間已司空見慣。毫無疑問，存儲已發展為具有最低性能和卓越性能的擴展存儲容量。 \n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Hard disk ( 硬盤 ) \n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Hard disk dissection ( 硬盤解剖 ) \n Hard drives are rated on several characteristics beyond the simple measurement of how much storage space they have. Most users will simply pick a drive based on the storage capacity, but the other performance factors can be even more important. If the drive is a SATA device, it can reach data transfer speeds of up to 6 Gbps, but that is dependent on how fast the drive can access the data from the disk. Hard drives have a spin rate, which is measured in rotations per minute (RPM). It is common for hard drives to have a 5400 RPM rate, but more expensive drives have 7200 RPM, 10000 RPM, or even 15000 RPM rates. The faster spin rates are usually found in servers and high-performance gaming systems, but the 7200 RPM drives are becoming more commonplace as prices continue to decline. Hard disks also have an internal buffer or cache. A inexpensive drive may have a buffer of only 8 MB, while a more expensive drive will have 64 MB of buffer. The bigger the buffer, the better the performance, and the faster the data retrieval from the disk. \n 除了簡單地測量硬盤具有多少存儲空間外，還對硬盤進行了多種評估。大多數用戶只會根據存儲容量選擇一個驅動器，但其他性能因素可能更為重要。如果驅動器是 SATA 設備，則它可以達到高達 6 Gbps 的數據傳輸速度，但這取決於驅動器可以從磁盤訪問數據的速度。硬盤驅動器具有旋轉速度，該旋轉速度以每分鐘的旋轉數（ RPM ）度量。硬盤驅動器通常具有 5400 RPM 的速率，但是更昂貴的驅動器具有 7200 RPM ， 10000 RPM 甚至 15000 RPM 的速率。在服務器和高性能遊戲系統中通常可以找到更快的旋轉速度，但是隨著價格的不斷下降， 7200 RPM 驅動器變得越來越普遍。硬盤還具有內部緩衝區或緩存。便宜的驅動器可能只有 8 MB 的緩衝區，而價格更高的驅動器將有 64 MB 的緩衝區。緩衝區越大，性能越好，並且從磁盤檢索數據的速度越快。 \n The newest technology in the storage arena is the solid state drive (SSD). As with most technology, this was fairly expensive when first introduced into the market, but pricing has leveled off and most PC manufacturers offer an SSD solution on new machines. \n 固態硬盤（ SSD ）是存儲領域中的最新技術。與大多數技術一樣，這在首次投入市場時相當昂貴，但價格趨於平穩，大多數 PC 製造商都在新機器上提供 SSD 解決方案。 \n Initially, in an effort to increase performance, some HDD manufacturers created a hybrid drive, combining a small solid state drive with a large traditional hard disk to give the user increased speed without the enormous cost of solid state drives. These devices are faster than a traditional drive, but not nearly as fast as an SSD. \n 最初，為了提高性能，一些 HDD 製造商創建了一種混合驅動器，將小型固態驅動器與大型傳統硬盤結合在一起，從而為用戶提供了提高的速度，而又沒有固態驅動器的巨額成本。這些設備比傳統驅動器快，但不及 SSD 快。 \n In addition to hybrid drives, Intel developed the mSata interface for mobile computing. The smaller form factor allows high-capacity SSD storage at the same access speeds by connecting to the SATA host controller. \n 除了混合驅動器，英特爾還開發了用於移動計算的 mSata 接口。較小的外形尺寸可以通過連接到 SATA 主機控制器以相同的訪問速度實現大容量 SSD 存儲。 \n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0SSD/HDD hybrid + HDD hard drive \n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 (SSD / HDD 混合 + HDD 硬盤驅動器 ) \n SSDs are intended to replace the traditional hard disk. They are fast and durable, and contain no moving parts. The SSD emulates a traditional hard drive and is often used in netbooks, Ultrabooks, and other lightweight systems, or machines that require fast, quiet performance. Most SSDs come in a 2.5-inch form factor, similar to a laptop hard disk, and use a 2.5-inch to 3.5-inch adapter when being placed in a desktop computer. The SSD can be built using multilevel cell (MLC) to save money, but these tend to be much slower than their more expensive and faster counterpart, the SLC (single level cell). Initially, these drives cost five to ten times as much as an equivalent-capacity traditional hard disk. Market demand and increased production have helped lower the pricing. As of the end of 2015, a 2.5-inch 250 GB SATAIII SSD can be purchased for less than $100, but the same amount of money would purchase a traditional 2 TB HDD. But, they are significantly faster and quieter, since they can access the information directly without having to wait for the hard disk to spin up and find the data on the disk. \n SSD 旨在替代傳統硬盤。它們既快速又耐用，並且沒有活動部件。 SSD 模仿傳統的硬盤驅動器，通常用於上網本，超極本和其他輕量級系統，或需要快速，安靜性能的機器中。大多數 SSD 的外形尺寸為 2.5 英寸，類似於筆記本電腦的硬盤，並且放在台式機中時使用 2.5 英寸至 3.5 英寸的適配器。可以使用多層單元（ MLC ）來構建 SSD ，以節省資金，但是這些 SSD 往往比價格更高，速度更快的同類產品 SLC （單層單元）慢得多。最初，這些驅動器的成本是同等容量的傳統硬盤的五至十倍。市場需求和產量增加幫助降低了定價。截至 2015 年底，已有 2 。可以不到 100 美元的價格購買 5 英寸 250 GB SATAIII SSD ，但是用同樣的錢可以購買傳統的 2 TB HDD 。但是，它們可以更快，更安靜地運行，因為它們可以直接訪問信息，而不必等待硬盤啟動並在磁盤上查找數據。 \n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Solid state drive (SSD) \n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 ( 固態驅動器（ SSD ） ) \n A redundant array of inexpensive drives (RAID) combines numerous traditional physical hard drives into a single logical disk to provide a faster or more redundant singular drive. RAID 0 (RAID zero) uses at least two drives to act as a single drive, using striping to boost performance. But, if either drive fails, all the data is lost. Therefore, with RAID 0, the user gains speed but does not gain any redundancy. RAID 1 (RAID one) uses at least two drives to act as a single drive, using mirroring to boost redundancy. Every time the drive is written to by the computer, two copies of the information are written (one to each drive). So, if either drive fails, all the data is still accessible and safe on the other drive. With RAID 1 the user gains redundancy, but does not gain any speed. \n 廉價驅動器冗餘陣列（ RAID ）將眾多傳統物理硬盤驅動器組合到單個邏輯磁盤中，以提供更快或更冗餘的單個驅動器。 RAID 0 （ RAID 0 ）至少使用兩個驅動器作為一個驅動器，並通過 條帶化 來提高性能。但是，如果任何一個驅動器發生故障，所有數據都會丟失。因此，使用 RAID 0 ，用戶可以提高速度，但不會獲得任何冗餘。 RAID 1 （ RAID 1 ）使用鏡像至少使用兩個驅動器作為一個驅動器 提高冗餘度。每次計算機寫入驅動器時，都會寫入兩份信息副本（每個驅動器一份）。因此，如果任何一個驅動器發生故障，所有數據仍然可以在另一個驅動器上訪問並且安全。使用 RAID 1 ，用戶可以獲得冗餘，但不會獲得任何速度。 \n Since RAID 0 gave us speed with no redundancy, and RAID 1 gave us redundancy with no increase in speed, engineers developed a hybrid of the two called RAID 01 or RAID 10. In RAID 01 or 10, four drives are combined using the striping from RAID 0 with the mirroring from RAID 1 to gain both speed and redundancy. The only problem with this solution is that you lose fifty percent of the storage space (just like we did in RAID 1) to overhead 、 redundancy. To overcome this, another variant, RAID 5, was established. In RAID 5, at least three drives are required and they operate as a single logical drive. When information is written to the drive, that information is striped across the drives and a parity is also spread across the drives. If a single drive fails, the information can be rebuilt using the existing information and parity information to fill in the missing pieces. Using hot-swappable drives, a bad drive can be removed, a new one inserted, and the RAID rebuilt without any downtime (though a performance loss will occur while the RAID is being rebuilt). \n 由於 RAID 0 為我們提供了無冗餘的速度，而 RAID 1 為我們提供了無速度的冗餘，因此工程師開發了兩種混合的 RAID 01 或 RAID10 。在 RAID 01 或 10 中，四個驅動器通過使用具有從 RAID 1 鏡像的 RAID 0 ，可同時獲得速度和冗餘。該解決方案的唯一問題是，您會損失 50 ％的存儲空間（就像我們在 RAID 1 中所做的一樣）以增加開銷、冗餘。為了克服這個問題，建立了另一個變體 RAID 5 。在 RAID 5 中，至少需要三個驅動器，它們可作為單個邏輯驅動器運行。將信息寫入驅動器後，該信息將在驅動器上分條，並且奇偶校驗也會分佈在驅動器上。如果單個驅動器發生故障，可以使用現有信息和奇偶校驗信息來重建信息，以填充丟失的部分。使用可熱插拔的驅動器，可以卸下損壞的驅動器，插入新的驅動器，並且可以在不造成任何停機的情況下重建 RAID （儘管在重建 RAID 時會造成性能損失）。 \n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Stripe of RAID Mirrors (RAID 鏡像條帶 ) \n To create a RAID array, the workstation must have either a PATA or SATA hardware controller that supports hardware RAIDs. Some motherboards support these natively, while others will require the user to purchase an expansion card to perform these functions. If your system doesn’t support hardware RAIDs, Windows does support software RAIDs on all systems, but you will lose the benefits of the RAID for the main operating system using this approach. \n 要創建 RAID 陣列，工作站必須具有支持硬件 RAID 的 PATA 或 SATA 硬件控制器。一些主板本身支持這些功能，而另一些則需要用戶購買擴展卡才能執行這些功能。如果您的系統不支持硬件 RAID ，則 Windows 會在所有系統上都支持軟件 RAID ，但是使用這種方法，您將失去主操作系統的 RAID 優勢。 \n Hardware RAIDs require at least two hard disks for RAID 0 or RAID 1, at least three disks for RAID 5, and at least four disks for RAID 10 or RAID 01. To create a software RAID, you can use Windows’ disk management software to create the RAIDs for data drives and other partitions. \n 硬件 RAID 至少需要兩個硬盤用於 RAID 0 或 RAID 1 ，至少三個磁盤用於 RAID 5 ，以及至少四個磁盤用於 RAID 10 或 RAID01 。要創建軟件 RAID ，可以使用 Windows 的磁盤管理軟件來創建 RAID 。為數據驅動器和其他分區創建 RAID 。 \nStorage Devices Drive Interfaces 存儲設備 驅動器接口\n Computers require several things to function well: a method to receive data input, a method to process data, a way to output data, and a way to store data. Data storage has evolved over the years, but the most common storage mechanism, the hard disk, has been around for more than 35 years. The only real change has been in physical size (they have gotten smaller), logical size (they can store much more data), speed, and connector types. The most common types of connectors are SATA, PATA IDE, SCSI, floppy, eSATA, FireWire, USB, and network connections, each of which we will discuss. \n 計算機需要幾件事情才能正常運行：一種接收數據輸入的方法，一種處理數據的方法，一種輸出數據的方法以及一種存儲數據的方法。數據存儲已經發展了多年，但是最常見的存儲機制硬盤已經存在了 35 年以上。唯一真正的變化是物理大小（變得更小），邏輯大小（它們可以存儲更多數據），速度和連接器類型。連接器最常見的類型是 SATA ， PATA\xa0 IDE ， SCSI ，軟盤， eSATA ， FireWire ， USB 和網絡連接，我們將分別討論它們。 \n PATA (Parallel Advanced Technology Attachment) has been around since the 1980s, but used to be called IDE (Integrated Drive Electronics). This type of connector uses a cable made up of 40 wires or 80 wires (which supported cable select mode). Both types of cables had 40 pins on each end. The newer-style cables were color-coded, so that the blue connector attached to the motherboard, the black connector attached to the primary (or master) device, and the gray connector attached to the secondary (or slave) device. This connector type was used for hard disk drives, CD drives, DVD drives, and some tape backup drives. Each of these devices has a jumper on it that must be set to “master,” “slave,” or “cable select” mode. “Cable select” eliminated the need to manually assign the master or slave. Each cable could support up to two devices, but only one master or slave device could be used on each cable. The BIOS had to be configured properly before using these devices. In spite of improvements to the EIDE interface using Ultra Direct Memory Access (UDMA), Serial ATA (SATA) is not limited to four devices per channel and has much faster access times. \n PATA （並行高級技術附件）自 1980 年代就出現了，但以前被稱為 IDE （集成驅動電子設備）。這種類型的連接器使用由 40 線或 80 線組成的電纜（支持電纜選擇模式）。兩種類型的電纜的每端都有 40 個插針。較新樣式的電纜已進行了顏色編碼，因此藍色連接器連接至主板，黑色連接器連接至主（或主）設備，灰色連接器連接至輔助（或從屬）設備。此連接器類型用於硬盤驅動器， CD 驅動器， DVD 驅動器和某些磁帶備份驅動器。這些設備中的每一個都有跳線，必須將其設置為“主”，“從”或“電纜選擇”模式。“電纜選擇”消除了手動分配主機或從機的需要。每條電纜最多可支持兩個設備，但是每條電纜上只能使用一個主設備或從設備。使用這些設備之前，必須正確配置 BIOS 。儘管使用超直接內存訪問（ UDMA ）對 EIDE 接口進行了改進，但串行 ATA （ SATA ）不僅限於每個通道四個設備，而且訪問速度更快。 \n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 IDE drive (IDE 驅動器 ) \n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Drive cables( 驅動器電纜 ) \n SATA is the current connection method used for hard disks and optical drives. It is called serial because only a single device can be attached to each cable, and the data is transmitted in serial fashion (one bit at a time). These devices often do not have jumpers, but if they have one, it is used to configure the speed of data transfer or to enable a special feature like spread spectrum clocking . SATA is a peripheral device and is very fast, allowing for speeds of up to 6 Gbps for the newer version, or 3 Gbps for the older versions. The data cable is shaped like an L, with seven pins for data. The power cable is also L-shaped, but has 15 pins. Internal SATA ports can be converted to an eSATA (external SATA) port simply by using a header to connect the internal port. \n SATA 是用於硬盤和光盤驅動器的當前連接方法。之所以稱為串行，是因為每條電纜只能連接一個設備，並且數據以串行方式（一次一位）傳輸。這些設備通常沒有跳線，但如果有跳線，則可用於配置數據傳輸速度或啟用諸如擴頻時鐘等特殊功能 。 SATA 是外圍設備，速度非常快，新版本的速度高達 6 Gbps ，舊版本的速度高達 3 Gbps 。數據電纜的形狀像 L 形，有七個數據針。電源線也為 L 形，但有 15 針。只需使用接頭連接內部端口，即可將內部 SATA 端口轉換為 eSATA （外部 SATA ）端口。 \n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 SATA drive (SATA 驅動器 ) \n SCSI, or small computer system interface, supports daisy-chaining of devices (internally or externally) with either seven devices (narrow SCSI) or 15 devices (wide SCSI). Each device in the chain is provided with a Device ID number that is configured using a selector switch, DIP (dual inline package) switch, or jumper block. SCSI is an older technology and has largely been replaced by SATA and eSATA. Narrow SCSI could only support speeds of up to 40 MBps, while wide SCSI could support up to 320 MBps. \n SCSI 或小型計算機系統接口支持將設備（內部或外部）與 7 個設備（窄 SCSI ）或 15 個設備（寬 SCSI ）進行菊花鏈連接。鏈中的每個設備都提供了一個設備 ID 編號，該 ID 使用選擇器開關， DIP （雙列直插式封裝）開關或跳線塊進行配置。 SCSI 是一種較舊的技術，在很大程度上已被 SATA 和 eSATA 取代。窄 SCSI 只能支持高達 40 MBps 的速度，而寬 SCSI 可以支持高達 320 MBps 的速度。 \n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 HP Surestore DAT-drive with two blue SCSI ports on the back \n \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 (HP Surestore DAT 驅動器，背面有兩個藍色 SCSI 端口 ) \n Storage Devices Hot Swapping 存儲設備 熱插拔 \n When desktops were originally developed, they weren’t designed to allow for hot-swapping of devices. Hot-swapping is the act of adding or removing a device while the computer is still turned on. In the old days, the user would shut the system down, power the workstation off, then connect the device, and turn the machine back on, otherwise the computer wouldn’t recognize the new device. In the late 1990s, the Windows operating system began to allow hot-swapping of devices, which included USB and FireWire. This allowed the user to simply plug in a device, wait a few seconds, and then begin using it to store or retrieve data. Due to this hot-swapping, it is important that users use the “eject drive safely” feature in Windows before unplugging a device, otherwise data loss will occur. SATA eSATA also support hot-swapping, but only if AHCI (advanced host controller interface) is selected during configuration in the BIOS. If not, the drive will work as if it is an older PATA IDE device and will not support hot-swapping. \n 最初開發台式機時，它們的設計不允許熱插拔設備。熱交換是在計算機仍打開時添加或刪除設備的操作。在過去，用戶會關閉系統，關閉工作站電源，然後連接設備，然後重新啟動計算機，否則計算機將無法識別新設備。在 1990 年代後期， Windows 操作系統開始允許熱插拔設備，包括 USB 和 FireWire 。這使用戶可以簡單地插入設備，等待幾秒鐘，然後開始使用它來存儲或檢索數據。由於這種熱交換，在拔出設備電源之前，用戶必須在 Windows 中使用“安全彈出驅動器”功能，這一點很重要，否則會導致數據丟失。 \xa0 SATA\xa0\xa0 eSATA 也支持熱插拔，但前提是在 BIOS 中配置期間選擇了 AHCI （高級主機控制器接口）。否則，驅動器將像舊的 PATA\xa0 IDE 設備一樣工作，並且不支持熱插拔。 \n", 'tags': '', 'url': 'PCH7\xa0Expansion Cards Audio Video and Storage 擴充卡 音頻 視頻和存儲 2.html'}, {'title': '40923208葉媛婷-1', 'text': 'PCH8: Cooling \n Heat Sources \n Overview\xa0 總覽 \n This module will discuss sources of heat and its effects, along with various ways to cool the CPU and system. \n 本模塊將討論熱源及其影響，以及冷卻CPU和系統的各種方法。\xa0\xa0 \n Heat Sources\xa0 熱源\xa0 \xa0 \n Heat is generated through thermal radiation as a by-product of electromagnetic movement within the circuits of our computers. The heat is caused by the internal resistance that the electricity encounters as it flows throughout the computer, and this resistance creates enough heat that the computer often becomes very, very hot inside the case. Each component of the computer creates heat at a different rate, depending on the specific operations being performed. For example, the CPU generates the most heat, since it does the greatest number of computations and uses a large amount of electricity. Another common source of heat is the graphics processing unit (GPU), which does an enormous amount of processing when performing calculations required to support 3D graphics, such as those used in video gaming. Often, during gaming, the GPU will actually create more heat than the CPU. \n Other sources of heat include the hard disk and the optical disc drive, as the spinning of the disks during the read/write cycle can generate heat from both friction and electricity. Another component of the computer that generates an enormous amount of heat is the PSU, as it transforms AC power into DC power. Because it is such a large heat source, the power supply usually has its own dedicated cooling fan. \n Another potential source of heat is the room in which the computer is located. If you are working in a room with a high room temperature, such as 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius), the computer has to remove additional internal heat from the machine due to the environmental conditions of the room. \n 熱量是通過熱輻射產生的，這些熱量是我們計算機電路內部電磁運動的副產品。熱量是由電流在整個計算機中流動時遇到的內部電阻引起的，並且該電阻產生的熱量足以使計算機在機殼內部變得非常非常熱。根據所執行的特定操作，計算機的每個組件以不同的速率產生熱量。例如，CPU產生的熱量最多，因為它進行了大量的計算並消耗大量電能。另一個常見的熱量來源是圖形處理單元（GPU），當執行支持3D圖形（例如視頻遊戲中使用的圖形）所需的計算時，它將進行大量處理。通常，在遊戲過程中 \n 其他熱源包括硬盤和光盤驅動器，因為在讀/寫週期中磁盤的旋轉會因摩擦和電而產生熱量。 產生大量熱量的計算機的另一個組件是PSU，它可以將交流電轉換為直流電。 由於電源如此之大，因此電源通常具有自己的專用冷卻風扇。 \n 另一個潛在的熱源是計算機所在的房間。 如果您在室溫較高的房間（例如華氏80度（27攝氏度））中工作，由於房間的環境條件，計算機必須從機器中清除其他內部熱量。 \n Heat Effects\xa0 熱效應 \n If the computer is unable to remove the heat created by the internal components or environmental heat, the BIOS of the computer may instruct intensive applications to slow down, thereby reducing the processing capability of the CPU and minimizing its heat output. Additionally, the BIOS may actually instruct various components to shut down in order to avoid overheating and possible damage to the components. This can cause the entire system to shut down without warning and can occur routinely unless a more efficient cooling system, such as a larger, more efficient fan, is outfitted into the computer. A system shutdown is rather commonplace in machines where overclocking has been performed, or in systems where a cooling fan has become damaged. \n Often there is no indication to the end user that an overheating condition is occurring, but even this can have severe consequences. Hard disk drives, CPUs, and GPUs are all sensitive to temperature changes. Hard drives in particular can become irreparably damaged by temperature changes due to the expansion and contraction of device components. This can cause read/write errors, or even a complete failure of the disk drive. \n 如果計算機無法消除內部組件產生的熱量或環境熱量，則計算機的BIOS可能會指示密集型應用程序放慢速度，從而降低CPU的處理能力並最小化其熱量輸出。此外，BIOS實際上可以指示各種組件關閉，以避免過熱和對組件的可能損壞。這可能會導致整個系統無預警地關閉，並且可能會常規發生，除非計算機中裝有更高效的冷卻系統（例如更大，更高效的風扇）。在執行超頻的機器中或在冷卻風扇已損壞的系統中，系統關閉非常普遍。 \n 通常，最終用戶沒有跡象表明發生了過熱情況，但即使這樣也會造成嚴重後果。 硬盤驅動器，CPU和GPU都對溫度變化敏感。 由於設備組件的膨脹和收縮，特別是硬盤驅動器會因溫度變化而造成不可挽回的損害。 這可能導致讀/寫錯誤，甚至導致磁盤驅動器完全故障。 \n Heat Reduction\xa0 減少熱量 \n There are many ways to reduce the amount of heat generated in a computer, but the most notable way is the use of a heat sink, like the one pictured below in green. A heat sink works to draw heat away from the sensitive components, such as the CPU, GPU, northbridge, and southbridge, through conduction. It then uses the fins to dissipate heat across a wider surface area. A fan usually moves air over the surface to remove the heat from the heat sink and push it out the computer’s exhaust vents on the back of the system. Heat sinks are created out of aluminum alloys or copper, which are soft metals with high heat conductivity. \n Modern PCs can create a great deal of heat and require the use of both a heat sink and a cooling fan to aid in airflow and reduce the effect of heat on the nearby components. Case design is important to create good air flow through the case. Just like opening the windows and doors of a house can create a straight-through wind tunnel effect, cases are built to maximize airflow. Also, cables inside the case should be bundled and tucked out of the way to increase airflow and maximize cooling. \n 有許多方法可以減少計算機中產生的熱量，但是最顯著的方法是使用散熱器，如下面的綠色圖片所示。 散熱器通過傳導將熱量從敏感組件（例如CPU，GPU，北橋和南橋）吸走。 然後，它使用散熱片在更寬的表面積上散熱。 風扇通常在表面上移動空氣，以從散熱器中散熱，然後將其從系統背面的計算機排氣孔中推出。 散熱器由鋁合金或銅製成，而鋁合金或銅是具有高導熱性的軟金屬。 \n 現代PC會產生大量熱量，並且需要同時使用散熱器和冷卻風扇來幫助氣流並減少熱量對附近組件的影響。 機箱設計對於在機箱中產生良好的氣流很重要。 就像打開房屋的門窗可以產生直通的風洞效果一樣，箱體也可以最大化氣流。 另外，應捆紮和捆紮外殼內的電纜，以增加氣流並最大程度地冷卻。 \n \n BIOS Settings \n Most modern motherboards and BIOS support temperature monitoring and control for the motherboard and its components. The name for this varies depending on manufacturer, but often it is called PC health or temperature monitoring. For motherboards that support overclocking, you can configure the settings in the BIOS to increase or decrease your processing capability, and thereby prevent additional heat from being generated. The CPU has a sensor that monitors its temperature, and the BIOS can increase or decrease the fan speed to control the temperature of the CPU. Remember, though, by reducing the power consumption (and therefore heat), you are also simultaneously reducing the performance of the CPU. \n 大多數現代主板和BIOS支持對主板及其組件進行溫度監控。 其名稱因製造商而異，但通常稱為PC運行狀況或溫度監控。 對於支持超頻的主板，您可以在BIOS中配置設置以增加或減少處理能力，從而防止產生更多的熱量。 CPU具有監視其溫度的傳感器，BIOS可以增加或減小風扇速度以控制CPU的溫度。 但是請記住，通過減少功耗（並因此減少熱量），您同時也在降低CPU的性能。 \n \n Cooling Methods \n Over the decades, various cooling methods have been introduced, with each one having its own advantages and disadvantages. \n 幾十年來，已經引入了各種冷卻方法，每種方法都有其自身的優點和缺點。 \n Active Air Cooling\xa0 主動風冷 \n Active air cooling components consist of a fan and a cooling plate (heat sink) made of aluminum or copper. A fan blows fresh air on a heat sink placed over the components that need to be cooled. The heat sink’s fins increase the surface of the metal plate and increase the heat exchange capabilities of the component. The fan blows the air between those fins, making the heat exchange quicker and more efficient, as it rapidly removes the heated air that is produced between the fins. There is only one drawback to active air cooling: the component that generates heat can never be cooled below the ambient room temperature. This is because active cooling uses forced air from the room, and the room air cannot cool a component to a lower temperature than the ambient temperature. These components are very reliable, and the cost of this system is quite affordable. \n 主動空氣冷卻組件由風扇和鋁或銅製成的冷卻板（散熱器）組成。 風扇將新鮮空氣吹到放置在需要冷卻的組件上方的散熱器上。 散熱器的散熱片增加了金屬板的表面，並增加了組件的熱交換能力。 風扇在這些散熱片之間吹動空氣，從而使熱交換更快，更有效，因為它可以快速去除散熱片之間產生的熱空氣。 主動空氣冷卻只有一個缺點：產生熱量的組件永遠無法冷卻到室溫以下。 這是因為主動冷卻使用來自房間的強制空氣，並且房間空氣無法將組件冷卻到比環境溫度低的溫度。 這些組件非常可靠， \n Passive Air Cooling\xa0 被動風冷 \n Similar to the active air cooling method, passive air cooling uses a heat sink to create a larger cooling surface of a component. The difference lies in the size of the heat sink, though, since passive air cooling relies solely on the size of the fins to reduce the heat. These fins must be large enough and must also have enough space between them so that a natural flow of air can be achieved that will adequately remove the heat. These heat sinks can become quite heavy and require special parts to be fixed over the part to be cooled. Passive air cooling is the most efficient way of cooling in terms of power saving, since it uses no power to operate. The drawback to this method is weight, since heavy and large heat sinks must be fixed over small parts, increasing the total weight of a computer and reducing the usable area inside the case. Additionally, this method doesn’t work well when the ambient temperature is high, because high ambient temperature causes the passive air cooling to become ineffective. \n 類似於主動空氣冷卻方法，被動空氣冷卻使用散熱器來創建較大的組件冷卻表面。 不過，區別在於散熱器的大小，因為被動空氣冷卻僅依賴散熱片的大小來減少熱量。 這些散熱片必須足夠大，並且它們之間還必須具有足夠的空間，以便可以實現自然的空氣流動，從而充分散熱。 這些散熱器會變得很重，需要將特殊零件固定在要冷卻的零件上。 就省電而言，被動式空氣冷卻是最有效的冷卻方式，因為它不使用任何電源進行操作。 這種方法的缺點是重量大，因為必須將重型散熱器和大型散熱器固定在較小的零件上，這會增加計算機的總重量並減小機箱內部的可用面積。 \n Liquid Cooling\xa0 液體冷卻 \n Modern CPUs generate twice as much heat as CPUs did five years ago. This is even truer for the GPUs. For example, a powerful dual-processor graphics card can generate as much as 380 watts of heat. Many contemporary machines use multiple processors and graphics cards, making the efficient cooling of these components a priority. Removing such vast amounts of heat in a space-constrained environment such as a computer chassis is traditionally done at the cost of an uncomfortably high noise level from the fan. Liquid cooling minimizes the noise level required. Liquid cooling is also the best solution for rapid heat removal due to the high thermal output of the GPUs and CPUs in gaming systems and high performance computers respectively. A water block normally offers a lower profile cooling solution and it allows double computational power in the same cubic footprint. The liquid cooling system dramatically lowers the operational temperatures and increases the ability to overclock CPUs to higher levels without damage. \n Liquid cooling takes advantage of a basic principle of thermodynamics — that heat moves from warmer objects to cooler objects. As the cooler object gets warmer, the warmer object gets cooler. The sole purpose is to transfer heat (energy) away from critical computer components quickly and effectively. The heat is usually transferred to the surrounding environment by dissipating the heat through the heat sink and radiators. Water has a high level of thermal conductivity, meaning it absorbs heat better than air. Liquid cooling works by running water through the channels in the water block attached to each of the components that require cooling, transferring heat from each part to a radiator that dissipates the heat and keeps the water cool — similar to a car\'s radiator. This lets the processor, graphics card, and other hardware cool down much more effectively. \n Liquid cooling allows the transfer of more heat from the components being cooled than air, making liquid cooling perfect for overclocking and high-performance computer applications. In comparison to air cooling, liquid cooling is not influenced by the ambient temperature, making it a better choice in environments with a high ambient heat. Also, liquid cooling has a relatively low noise level because it uses much quieter and smaller fans than those used in active cooling. \n The major drawbacks of liquid cooling are complexity and cost. Also, liquid cooling can be messy and cause damage when a failure in pipe connections occurs. Liquid cooling also needs a good deal of power to operate the pump. Despite some of these drawbacks, liquid cooling is still popular with gamers because of its efficiency and effectiveness. \n In a liquid cooled system, each component that requires cooling has a cooling plate (heat sink) attached to it. This heat sink, usually made of copper or aluminum, is a hollow plate with an input and an output hose through which the coolant will flow. The circulating pump will circulate the coolant from the radiator to the cooling plates, then to the tank and back to the radiator, where the heat is dissipated. \n Here are more details about each component: \n Radiator : The radiator moves the absorbed heat into the surrounding environment by using a cooling fan to effectively cool the liquid. The bigger the radiator, the more effective it becomes, which results in lower liquid temperature and a lower component temperature. \n Water block : The water block (or heat sink) absorbs the heat from the microprocessor. It contains microfins that are used to boost the surface area for more optimal heat transfer. As the liquid flows through the water block, it absorbs the heat. If you have a more efficient water block, your overall component temperature will decrease. \n Water pump : The water pump provides the circulation of the liquid in the cooling loop from the hot side to the cold side. This allows for effective heat transfer throughout the entire loop. Without a good water pump, the liquid would stagnate in the loop and heat transfer would not occur. \n Reservoir : The reservoir unit allows for easier removal of air after the initial liquid cooling installation and serves as an expansion area for the coolant during temperature fluctuations. \n 現代CPU產生的熱量是五年前的兩倍。對於GPU來說更是如此。例如，功能強大的雙處理器圖形卡可以產生多達380瓦的熱量。許多現代機器使用多個處理器和圖形卡，因此優先考慮有效冷卻這些組件。傳統上，在空間受限的環境（例如計算機機箱）中清除如此大量的熱量，是要付出代價的，否則風扇會產生令人不快的高噪音水平。液體冷卻可將所需的噪音降至最低。由於分別在遊戲系統和高性能計算機中的GPU和CPU的高熱量輸出，液體冷卻也是快速散熱的最佳解決方案。水冷塊通常提供較低輪廓的冷卻解決方案，並且在相同的立方尺寸內可以實現雙倍的計算能力。液體冷卻系統顯著降低了工作溫度，並增強了將CPU超頻到更高水平而不會造成損壞的能力。 \n 液體冷卻利用了熱力學的基本原理，即熱量從較熱的物體轉移到較冷的物體。 隨著較冷的物體變熱，較熱的物體變冷。 唯一的目的是快速有效地將熱量（能量）從關鍵計算機組件中轉移出去。 通常通過通過散熱器和散熱器散發熱量，將熱量傳遞到周圍環境。 水的導熱係數很高，這意味著它比空氣吸收的熱量更好。 液體冷卻的工作原理是使水流過連接到需要冷卻的每個組件的水冷塊中的通道，將熱量從每個零件傳遞到散熱器，該散熱器散發熱量並使水保持涼爽，類似於汽車的散熱器。 這樣，處理器，圖形卡， \n 液體冷卻使被冷卻的組件比空氣傳遞更多的熱量，使液體冷卻非常適合超頻和高性能計算機應用。 與空氣冷卻相比，液體冷卻不受環境溫度的影響，因此使其在環境熱量較高的環境中成為更好的選擇。 而且，液體冷卻的噪音水平相對較低，因為與主動冷卻相比，液體冷卻使用的風扇更安靜，更小。 \n 液體冷卻的主要缺點是複雜性和成本。 同樣，當管道連接發生故障時，液體冷卻可能會造成混亂，並造成損壞。 液體冷卻還需要大量功率才能操作泵。 儘管存在這些缺點，但液體冷卻由於其效率和有效性而仍然受到遊戲玩家的歡迎。 \n 在液冷系統中，需要冷卻的每個組件都有一個連接的冷卻板（散熱器）。 該散熱器通常由銅或鋁製成，是一個帶有輸入和輸出軟管的中空板，冷卻液將流過該軟管。 循環泵將使冷卻劑從散熱器循環到冷卻板，然後再到水箱，再回到散熱器，在那兒散熱。 \n 以下是有關每個組件的更多詳細信息： \n 散熱器 ：散熱器通過使用冷卻風扇有效地冷卻液體，將吸收的熱量轉移到周圍環境中。 散熱器越大，散熱器越有效，從而導致較低的液體溫度和較低的組件溫度。 \n 水塊 ：水塊（或散熱器）從微處理器吸收熱量。 它包含微翅片，這些微翅片用於增加表面積以實現更佳的熱傳遞。 當液體流過水塊時，它吸收熱量。 如果您使用更有效的阻水劑，則組件的整體溫度將會降低。 \n 水泵 ：水泵提供冷卻迴路中從熱側到冷側的液體循環。 這允許在整個迴路中進行有效的熱傳遞。 沒有良好的水泵，液體將滯留在迴路中，並且不會發生熱傳遞。 \n 儲 ：儲存器單元允許初始液體冷卻安裝後容易除去空氣，並作為在溫度波動的冷卻的膨脹區域。 \n \n CPU Cooling \n In the lab below, you should install a new CPU. For the purpose of this lab, we have removed the computer\'s case for you. You will also need to apply thermal paste, install the heat sink and install the cooling fan. For the purposes of this lab exercise, you can assume that ESD precautions are in place. \n For maintenance, it is important to clear the fan blades and heat sink of dust at least every six months. This is a quick and easy maintenance task. Blowing compressed air into the fan blades and across the heat sink fins will keep the cooling system running smoothly. \n 在下面的實驗室中，您應該安裝一個新的CPU。 為了本實驗的目的，我們為您卸下了計算機機箱。 您還需要塗導熱膏，安裝散熱器和安裝冷卻風扇。 就本練習而言，您可以假定已採取ESD預防措施。 \n 對於維護，重要的是至少每六個月清潔一次風扇葉片和散熱器的灰塵。 這是一項快速簡便的維護任務。 將壓縮空氣吹入風扇葉片並穿過散熱片將使冷卻系統保持平穩運行。 \n Case Fans\xa0 機箱風扇 \n Case fans are necessary to remove all the hot air generated by computer components, especially video cards and CPUs. The hot air has to be vented out and replaced by cooler air. Cool air can usually be found closer to the ground, since heat tends to rise, so most cases are designed so that cooler air is pulled into the system at the bottom by the front case fan. Air is then exhausted out the rear-top of the case near the CPU as well as out of the side of the case near the graphics processing unit. \n 機箱風扇對於消除計算機組件（尤其是視頻卡和CPU）產生的所有熱空氣是必不可少的。 必須排出熱空氣，並用涼爽的空氣代替。 通常會發現較冷的空氣更靠近地面，因為熱量會增加，因此大多數情況下都設計成使較冷的空氣被前殼風扇從底部吸入系統。 然後，空氣從CPU附近的機箱後部以及圖形處理單元附近的機箱側面排出。 \n EXAMPLE \n Here is a common case fan setup: \n 1x fan in the bottom-front of the case, near the drive bays (intake). \n 1x fan in the rear-top of the case, "behind" and above the CPU (exhaust). \n 1x fan in the side of the case, across from the GPU (intake). \n This setup pulls air in through the front, channels it through the drive bays, around the video card, and out the exhaust fan. The side fan forces air directly onto the hottest component (the GPU), and is then pushed up by the front fan and channeled out of the rear exhaust fan. \n 這是一個常見的風扇設置： \n 機箱底部前部靠近驅動器托架（進氣口）的1個風扇。 \n 機箱後部頂部，CPU上方（排氣口之後）和上方的1個風扇。 \n 機箱側面有1個風扇，與GPU相對（進氣）。 \n 此設置將空氣從前部吸入，通過驅動器托架將其引導到視頻卡周圍，然後從排氣風扇中排出。 側風扇將空氣直接壓到最熱的組件（GPU）上，然後由前風扇向上推動，並從後部排氣風扇中導出。 \n \n Case Fans: Installation \n The following steps will enable you to install a case fan. First, you must ensure that your PC is powered off before you install any component in your system. After opening the case, you will need a Phillips head screwdriver in order to remove/install case fans. If you’re replacing a fan, simply remove the old one by unscrewing it from the case and unplugging the cable from the header (or the MOLEX connection, if you have an older system). To mount the new fan, hold the fan up to the mounting position so that the holes for screws line up with the holes in the case. While holding the fan in place with one hand, with your other hand use four screws to secure it in place. Some models use plastic friction clips to hold the fan in place instead of screws. If the system is like this, simply un-snap the clips, remove the fan, and pop the new one in its place. \n After you secure the fan, you need to attach the fan to an unused fan header to provide the fan with power. The headers are keyed to ensure a proper connection and prevent you from plugging them in backwards. Four-pin headers will work with three-pin fans, but you will not be able to control fan speeds, since this is only performed by the fourth pin in the connector. \n When you are done installing the fan, make sure you route your fan and other cables using proper cable management techniques and some zip-ties. Proper cable management prevents the fans from hitting the cables when they spin and also aids in proper airflow to increase cooling efficiency. Be sure to power up the computer and make sure the fan is working properly. \n In the lab exercise below, you should remove the old case fan and install a new case fan. Be sure to use proper safety precautions. For the purposes of this lab exercise, you can assume that ESD precautions are in place. \n 以下步驟將使您能夠安裝機箱風扇。首先，在安裝系統中的任何組件之前，必須確保已關閉PC的電源。打開機箱後，您將需要使用十字螺絲刀來拆卸/安裝機箱風扇。如果要更換風扇，只需將舊風扇從機箱中擰出並從插頭（或MOLEX連接，如果您使用較舊的系統）上拔下電纜，即可將其卸下。要安裝新風扇，請將風扇保持在安裝位置，以使螺釘孔與外殼上的孔對齊。一隻手將風扇固定到位，另一隻手用四顆螺釘將其固定到位。某些型號使用塑料摩擦夾而不是螺釘將風扇固定到位。如果系統是這樣的，只需取消卡扣，卸下風扇， \n 固定風扇後，需要將風扇連接到未使用的風扇接頭連接器上，以為風扇供電。 標頭的鍵可確保正確連接，並防止您向後插入標頭。 四針接頭連接器將與三針風扇一起使用，但是您將無法控制風扇速度，因為這只能由連接器中的第四針執行。 \n 完成安裝風扇後，請確保使用正確的電纜管理技術和一些紮帶來布放風扇和其他電纜。 正確的電纜管理可防止風扇在旋轉時撞到電纜，並有助於適當的氣流以提高冷卻效率。 確保打開計算機電源，並確保風扇正常工作。 \n 在下面的實驗練習中，您應該卸下舊的機箱風扇並安裝新的機箱風扇。 確保使用適當的安全預防措施。 就本練習而言，您可以假定已採取ESD預防措施。 \n Liquid Cooling: Installation\xa0 液體冷卻：安裝 \n Installing liquid cooling systems in contemporary computers is not as difficult as it once was. As always, begin by powering down the computer and unplugging it. Then open the case and install the processor in the same manner as detailed earlier. Next, clean the CPU and water block and remove dust and debris. Then, use thermal paste, just like we did in the active cooling systems. After that, instead of using a traditional heat sink, attach a water block. Next, install the radiator in place of the rear case fan. Then connect the radiator to the reservoir. Be sure to reconnect the power, power on the computer, and make sure the liquid cooling system is working properly.

An expansion card is inserted into the expansion slot. There are many different types of expansion slots on a motherboard. The function of each of these types of slots will be discussed in far greater detail in a future module. Below is a brief summary of the most common types of expansion slots. 擴展插槽可提供計算機系統的其他功能。擴展卡已插入擴展槽。主板上有許多不同類型的擴展插槽。這些類型的插槽中的每一種的功能將在以後的模塊中進行更詳細的討論。以下是最常見的擴展插槽類型的簡要概述。   PCI — The conventional peripheral component interconnect slot, commonly referred to using its acronym.   PCI —傳統的外圍組件互連插槽，通常使用其縮寫詞來指代。   PCI-X — A faster, 64-bit version of the PCI slot running at a bus speed of 133 MHz.   PCI-X — PCI插槽的更快的64位版本，以133 MHz的總線速度運行。   AGP — A dedicated graphics channel (bus) designed to be separate from the shared PCI bus. This allowed advances in 3D game design, hardware acceleration, and video playback.   AGP —專用於與共享PCI總線分開的專用圖形通道（總線）。這使得3D遊戲設計，硬件加速和視頻播放方面有了進步。   PCIe — PCI express speeds exceed AGP speeds, and PCIe provides a singular slot type for all devices.   PCIe — PCI Express的速度超過了AGP的速度，並且PCIe為所有設備提供了單個插槽類型。   AMR — The audio modem riser card is a specific type of card used to fit additional cards into a compact space.   AMR —音頻調製解調器轉接卡是一種特殊類型的卡，用於將其他卡裝入緊湊的空間。   CNR — The communications network riser replaced the AMR, and allows for six-channel digital audio, networking functions, and other high-quality integrated audio support on a riser card.   CNR —通信網絡轉接卡取代了AMR，並在轉接卡上支持六通道數字音頻，網絡功能和其他高質量的集成音頻支持。   Chipset芯片組 The chipset determines which CPUs a system can use, which integrated ports a system provides, and the type of expansion slots included in the motherboard. Where the motherboard’s form factor dictates the specific size, shape, and layout, the chipset determines what technologies are integrated into the board itself. Each chipset defines the memory controller, and specifies what kind of RAM can be used with the motherboard. This includes the type of RAM to be used (DDR, DDR2, DDR3, etc.) and the speed of the RAM (10600, 1333 MHz, etc.). The motherboard is broken down technologically into the “northbridge” and the “southbridge,” which will be discussed further in the next section. The chipset is designed by the manufacturer and cannot be upgraded or changed by the end user without replacing the entire motherboard. Therefore, it is important to carefully choose your motherboard and chipset before purchasing one that will meet your needs. 芯片組確定係統可以使用的CPU，系統提供的集成端口以及主板中包含的擴展插槽的類型。主板的尺寸決定了特定的尺寸，形狀和佈局，而芯片組則決定了將哪些技術集成到主板本身中。每個芯片組都定義了內存控制器，並指定了主板可以使用哪種RAM。這包括要使用的RAM的類型（DDR，DDR2，DDR3等）和RAM的速度（10600、1333 MHz等）。主板在技術上分為“北橋”和“南橋”，將在下一節中進一步討論。該芯片組由製造商設計，如果不更換整個主板，最終用戶將無法升級或更改。因此，在購買滿足您需求的主板和芯片組之前，請務必謹慎選擇。 Northbridge北橋 The northbridge is known by several names. The first, and most common, is the memory controller hub (MCH), but it can also be called the graphics memory controller hub (GMCH) on Intel motherboards with integrated graphics on the motherboard. The northbridge serves as a connection between the CPU and the memory banks (RAM), PCIe x16, AGP graphics expansion slots, and other high-speed components. Essentially, the CPU operates extremely fast (such as in the 3 GHz or higher speeds), and the various components around the computer cannot operate as fast. The northbridge acts as a buffer to keep the high-speed devices feeding information to the CPU. While the memory may operate in the 1 to 2 GHz range, there is still lag between it and the CPU. The northbridge consolidates all of the high-speed inputs in order to maximize the efficiency of the CPU. 北橋有幾個名字。第一個也是最常見的是內存控制器中樞（MCH），但也可以稱為Intel主板上具有集成顯卡的圖形內存控制器中樞（GMCH）。北橋用作CPU和內存庫（RAM），PCIe x16，AGP圖形擴展插槽以及其他高速組件之間的連接。從本質上講，CPU的運行速度非常快（例如3 GHz或更高的速度），並且計算機周圍的各種組件無法以如此快的速度運行。北橋充當緩衝區，以保持高速設備向CPU提供信息。雖然內存可以在1至2 GHz範圍內運行，但它與CPU之間仍然存在延遲。 Southbridge南橋 The southbridge is known as the input/output controller hub (ICH). The southbridge serves as a connection between the CPU and the low-speed components of the computer. For example, the hard disk operates at very slow speeds in comparison to the CPU, but the input from the user (from the keyboard and mouse) occurs at even a slower rate than the hard disk. The ICH consolidates the input from the mass storage devices, DVD/CD drives, hard disk drives, floppy drives, USB ports, PCI expansion slots, CMOS, and the port cluster’s input/output, and then passes that information from the southbridge to the northbridge, and then on to the CPU for processing. This process maximizes the efficiency of the CPU’s ability to process data by removing the wait time for slower components on the southbridge and keeping the CPU processing other data during idle cycles. 南橋被稱為輸入/輸出控制器集線器（ICH）。南橋用作CPU和計算機低速組件之間的連接。例如，與CPU相比，硬盤的運行速度非常慢，但是來自用戶（來自鍵盤和鼠標）的輸入發生的速度甚至比硬盤慢。ICH整合了大容量存儲設備，DVD / CD驅動器，硬盤驅動器，軟盤驅動器，USB端口，PCI擴展插槽，CMOS和端口群集的輸入/輸出的輸入，然後將該信息從南橋傳遞到北橋，然後到CPU進行處理。', 'tags': '', 'url': 'PCH5 Expansion Slots 擴展槽.html'}, {'title': 'PCH5 Jumpers 跳線', 'text': 'The motherboard also contains pins that provide additional configuration options to the computer system. These pins can be covered by a jumper device, a piece of plastic with a metallic interior that makes an electrical connection between a set of pins. The jumper allows for particular features to be enabled or disabled on the motherboard. 主板還包含用於為計算機系統提供其他配置選項的引腳。這些針腳可以用跨接器設備覆蓋，該跳線器是具有金屬內部的塑料片，在一組針腳之間建立電連接。跳線允許在主板上啟用或禁用特定功能。 Fan Connectors風扇連接器 Each motherboard has several connectors for fans, specifically for the CPU fan and the case fan. These connectors provide power to the fans from the motherboard (ultimately from the power supply to the main motherboard power connector, then to the fans themselves). Some newer motherboards can provide PC health status, such as the fan speed, fan power, the board temperature, and other statistics. Most case fan connectors only have three pins, but the CPU fan connector can have four pins, with one pin dedicated to speed control. The fan speed can then be increased or decreased depending on the temperature of the CPU and the motherboard. As the temperature rises, a signal is sent to increase speed control, which in turn cools down the CPU and motherboard. 每個主板都有幾個風扇連接器，特別是CPU風扇和機箱風扇。這些連接器從主板為風扇提供電源（最終從電源到主板的主電源連接器，再向風扇本身供電）。一些較新的主板可以提供PC運行狀況，例如風扇速度，風扇功率，板溫度和其他統計信息。大多數機箱風扇連接器只有三個引腳，但是CPU風扇連接器可以具有四個引腳，其中一個引腳專用於速度控制。然後，可以根據CPU和主板的溫度來增加或減少風扇速度。隨著溫度升高，將發送信號以提高速度控制，從而降低CPU和主板的溫度。 Audio Connectors音頻連接器 Motherboards also contain connectors for audio devices, such as auxiliary input or CD playback. Some cases feature audio jacks for headphones and microphones on the front of the case; these features require a cable that runs from the case front to the audio connector on the motherboard. Another connector on the motherboard may be for the Sony/Philips digital interchange format (SPDIF) that is connected from the motherboard to an optical SPDIF connection, known as a header. These various audio connectors look the same on the motherboard and are usually only distinguished by the labeling of the ports on the motherboard. They are typically located on one of the edges of the motherboard. 主板還包含音頻設備的接口，例如輔助輸入或CD播放。某些機箱的正面配有耳機和麥克風的音頻插孔；這些功能需要從機箱正面到主板上的音頻連接器的電纜。主板上的另一個連接器可能是Sony / Philips數字交換格式（SPDIF），該連接器從主板連接到光學SPDIF連接，稱為接頭。這些各種音頻連接器在主板上看起來相同，通常僅通過主板上端口的標記來區分。它們通常位於主板的邊緣之一上。 Front-Panel Connectors前面板連接器 The front panel connectors are shown in the image below with the various multicolored cables. The connectors allow the motherboard to send/receive information from the power switch, power LED light, hard drive activity light, reset button, and case speaker (if installed). The connectors are often grouped on the front edge of the motherboard, and tend to be small and difficult to install. Often, a technician will have to use tweezers to connect these to the plugs. These connectors are easily unplugged by accident when doing other work inside the computer, so it is a good practice to always recheck these connections before replacing the cover. For example, if the computer won’t power on, it may not be a power supply issue, it may simply be that the “power switch” front panel connector became unplugged. If the power switch isn’t completely plugged into the motherboard, the computer will not turn on. 下圖顯示了前面板連接器以及各種彩色電纜。連接器使母板可以從電源開關，電源LED指示燈，硬盤驅動器活動指示燈，重置按鈕和機箱揚聲器（如果已安裝）發送/接收信息。連接器通常分組在主板的前邊緣，並且往往很小且難以安裝。通常，技術人員將不得不使用鑷子將其連接到插頭。在計算機內進行其他工作時，很容易意外拔下這些接口，因此，最好在更換主機蓋之前重新檢查這些接口。例如，如果計算機無法開機，則可能不是電源問題，可能只是“電源開關”前面板連接器已拔出。如果電源開關未完全插入主板，則計算機將無法打開。', 'tags': '', 'url': 'PCH5 Jumpers 跳線.html'}, {'title': 'PCH5 Processor History 處理器歷史記錄', 'text': "The first microprocessors were manufactured in the 1970s. These microprocessors were built on NMOS (n-type metal-oxide semiconductor) logic and transistors. Early on, four-bit processors, like the Intel 4004, were common. The Intel 4004 had 2300 transistors. It performed 60,000 operations per second and addressed 640 bytes of memory, and operated at a speed of 740 kHz. The Intel 4004 cost approximately $200. Later in the decade, eight-bit processors such as the Motorola 6502 superseded the four-bit chips. The Motorola 6502 was an eight micrometer process technology chip that was four millimeters square. By the end of the 1970s, 16-bit processors emerged. 第一批微處理器於1970年代製造。這些微處理器基於NMOS（n型金屬氧化物半導體）邏輯和晶體管構建。早期，四位處理器（例如Intel 4004）很常見。英特爾4004具有2300個晶體管。它每秒執行60,000次操作，尋址640字節的內存，並以740 kHz的速度運行。英特爾4004的價格約為200美元。十年後，諸如摩托羅拉6502之類的八位處理器取代了四位芯片。摩托羅拉6502是8毫米製程技術芯片，面積為4毫米見方。到1970年代末，出現了16位處理器。 In the 1980s, 16-bit and 32-bit microprocessors were common among new designs, and CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) technology overtook NMOS. Transistor count increased dramatically during the decade. The home computers of the 1980s predominantly used processors that were introduced in the 1970s. Versions of the Motorola 6502, first released in 1975, and the Zilog Z80 (1976), were at the core of many home computers, such as the Commodore 64 and the ZX Spectrum. Even the first-generation IBM PC used a processor from the 1970s: the Intel 8088. It was not until Intel's 80286 (in the IBM PC AT), and later the 80386, that 1980s computers used 1980s-designed processors. These late-decade processors offered higher clock speeds and 32-bit word length as well as new operating modes, such as protected mode, that were not available in earlier chips. Specifically, the Intel 80386 was a 32-bit chip. It had more than 275,000 transistors and could perform more than five million instructions every second. The 80386 cost approximately $299. Critically, in these more advanced chips, protected mode allowed the use of virtual memory and brought the graphical user interface to business computers, beginning with Microsoft Windows 2.0. 在1980年代，新設計中普遍使用16位和32位微處理器，並且CMOS（互補金屬氧化物半導體）技術取代了NMOS。在過去的十年中，晶體管的數量急劇增加。1980年代的家用計算機主要使用1970年代引入的處理器。1975年首次發布的Motorola 6502和Zilog Z80（1976）的版本是許多家用計算機的核心，例如Commodore 64和ZX Spectrum。甚至第一代IBM PC都使用了1970年代的處理器：Intel8088。直到Intel的80286（在IBM PC AT中）和後來的80386，1980年代的計算機才使用1980年代設計的處理器。這些近十年來的處理器提供了更高的時鐘速度和32位字長以及新的工作模式，例如保護模式，早期芯片中沒有的功能。具體來說，英特爾80386是32位芯片。它擁有超過275,000個晶體管，每秒可執行超過500萬條指令。80386的價格約為299美元。至關重要的是，在這些更高級的芯片中，從Microsoft Windows 2.0開始，保護模式允許使用虛擬內存，並將圖形用戶界面帶入商用計算機。 The 32-bit microprocessor dominated the consumer market in the 1990s. Processor clock speeds increased by more than tenfold between 1990 and 1999, and 64-bit processors began to emerge later in the decade. In the 1990s, microprocessors no longer used the same clock speed for the processor and the RAM. This technology allowed for the improvement in processor speeds. In 1993, Intel released the Pentium processor. The Pentium chip was a 60 MHz processor. It incorporated 3.1 million transistors and sold for approximately $875. 32位微處理器在1990年代主導了消費市場。在1990年至1999年之間，處理器時鐘速度提高了十倍以上，並且在該十年後期開始出現64位處理器。在1990年代，微處理器不再為處理器和RAM使用相同的時鐘速度。這項技術可以提高處理器速度。1993年，英特爾發布了奔騰處理器。奔騰芯片是60 MHz處理器。它裝有310萬個晶體管，售價約為875美元。 In the 2000s, 64-bit processors became mainstream. Microprocessor clock speeds reached a ceiling because cooling technology peaked. The ability to dissipate heat from the processor had reached a limit. Instead of implementing expensive and impractical cooling systems, manufacturers looked to other methods to improve processor performance by using multicore processor technology. Overclocking was born in the 1990s, but came into its own in the 2000s. With the introduction of multicore technology, processor costs began to drop dramatically. 在2000年代，64位處理器成為主流。由於冷卻技術達到頂峰，微處理器時鐘速度達到了上限。散發處理器熱量的能力已達到極限。製造商沒有採用昂貴且不切實際的冷卻系統，而是尋求其他方法來使用多核處理器技術來提高處理器性能。超頻誕生於1990年代，但在2000年代就已誕生。隨著多核技術的引入，處理器成本開始急劇下降。 Off-the-shelf cooling systems designed for overclocked processors became more and more common, as did the concept of a PC designed for gaming. Over the decade, transistor counts increased by about an order of magnitude, a trend continued from previous decades. Processor sizes decreased about fourfold, from 180 nm to 45 nm. In 2007 AMD released the Athlon X2 processor line. The AMD Athlon X2 Brisbane series processed at a speed of 1.9 to 2.6 GHz and it included a 512 KB L2 cache. In 2012, AMD released the A10-5700 desktop processor. It included a 4M L2 cache and processed at a speed of 3.4 GHz, or 4.0 GHz in turbo mode. AMD’s A10-5800K, released at the same time as the A10-5700, included the same cache, but provided for processing speeds of 3.8 GHz or 4.2 GHz in turbo mode. In the 2010s, processors typically hold between 2.5 and 4 billion transistors. 設計用於超頻處理器的現成的冷卻系統變得越來越普遍，而設計用於遊戲的PC的概念也越來越普遍。在過去的十年中，晶體管的數量增加了大約一個數量級，這一趨勢延續了過去的幾十年。處理器尺寸從180 nm減少到45 nm約四倍。AMD在2007年發布了Athlon X2處理器系列。AMD Athlon X2 Brisbane系列以1.9至2.6 GHz的速度進行處理，並包含512 KB L2緩存。2012年，AMD發布了A10-5700台式機處理器。它包括一個4M L2高速緩存，並以3.4 GHz或Turbo模式下的4.0 GHz的速度進行處理。AMD的A10-5800K與A10-5700同時發布，具有相同的緩存，但在Turbo模式下可提供3.8 GHz或4.2 GHz的處理速度。在2010年代，處理器通常容納2.5至40億個晶體管。 CPU Technology\xa0 CPU技術 Over the years, various technologies have been added to the CPU to increase its speed and efficiency. The first of these technologies is called hyperthreading or HT technology. HT technology was originally developed by Intel. It allows the CPU to execute two “threads” within a single processor core. Essentially, the CPU emulates (or pretends to be) two CPUs instead of the single physical processor it really is. This allows for faster execution of programs. Consider a large classroom with many students, but only one instructor. If multiple students are asking questions, the instructor needs to answer everyone’s questions as quickly as possible. Instead of finishing the first question, then taking the second question, the hyperthreading would allow the instructor to begin answering the second question while the first question was still being answered. This effectively increases the instructor’s ability to answer more questions in a shorter period of time. 多年來，CPU已添加了各種技術以提高其速度和效率。這些技術中的第一個稱為超線程或HT技術。HT技術最初是由Intel開發的。它允許CPU在單個處理器內核中執行兩個“線程”。本質上，CPU模擬（或假裝為）兩個CPU，而不是實際的單個物理處理器。這樣可以更快地執行程序。考慮一間教室，教室裡有很多學生，但只有一位老師。如果有多個學生提出問題，則講師需要盡快回答每個人的問題。而不是先解決第一個問題，然後再回答第二個問題，超線程將允許教師在仍在回答第一個問題的同時開始回答第二個問題。這有效地提高了教師在較短時間內回答更多問題的能力。 The second technology, which is a vast improvement over hyperthreading, is called multicore design. In multicore designs, the processor (physically a single piece of hardware) contains multiple processors in the chip itself. These come in dual (two), quad (four), hexa (six), and octa (eight) core designs. An octa core design allows a single chip to contain up to eight processor cores. The eight processor cores enable simultaneous execution of eight different and unique processes. Previous to the multicore design, if you wanted multiple processors (like on a server), you had to have a special motherboard with multiple processor sockets and a special operating system that understood multiple processors. With a multicore design, a singular socket can be used, and any operating system can understand how to use the singular CPU (with multiple cores). 第二項技術是對超線程的巨大改進，稱為多核設計。在多核設計中，處理器（實際上是單個硬件）在芯片本身中包含多個處理器。這些芯片具有雙核（兩個），四核（四個），六核（六個）和八核（八個）設計。八核心設計允許單個芯片包含多達八個處理器核心。八個處理器內核可同時執行八個不同且唯一的進程。在多核設計之前，如果要使用多個處理器（例如在服務器上），則必須擁有一個帶有多個處理器插槽的特殊主板和一個能夠理解多個處理器的特殊操作系統。採用多核設計，可以使用單個插座。 Bus Speeds總線速度 The bus is the backbone communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer. The bus is measured in megahertz (MHz), which is the speed at which the bus operates. MHz is the number of clock-cycles that occur in a given second (MHz equals millions of times a second). While the motherboard’s bus operates at a fixed speed, the input/output ports and expansion slots all run at a unique speed determined by the devices connected to the respective slot. Each port can be configured or negotiated to run at the appropriate speed (up to a maximum value) for each device (such as FireWire, AGP, PCIe, PATA, SATA) as each connection type supports a different speed. 總線是骨幹通信系統，可在計算機內部組件之間傳輸數據。總線以兆赫（MHz）為單位，這是總線運行的速度。MHz是在給定的每秒內發生的時鐘週期數（MHz等於每秒數百萬次）。當主板總線以固定速度運行時，輸入/輸出端口和擴展插槽均以連接到相應插槽的設備所確定的唯一速度運行。每個端口都可以配置或協商為每個設備（例如FireWire，AGP，PCIe，PATA，SATA）以適當的速度（最大速度）運行，因為每種連接類型都支持不同的速度。 32-bit and 64-bit Processors 32位和64位處理器 There are both 32-bit and 64-bit processors. This is an important concept because if you are running a 32-bit processor or a 32-bit operating system, your computer can only access up to 4 GB of RAM. Windows will only access 3.25 GB of RAM if you are using a 32-bit version of Windows (such as Windows XP, or Vista/7 x86). The first 64-bit processor was the AMD Athlon 64. Those x64 processors are fully backward compatible with slower x86 software and devices. By using x64, the 4 GB limit of RAM is removed, allowing us to access 16 GB, 32 GB, 64 GB, or more of memory. 同時有32位和64位處理器。這是一個重要的概念，因為如果您運行的是32位處理器或32位操作系統，則計算機最多只能訪問4 GB的RAM。如果您使用32位版本的Windows（例如Windows XP或Vista / 7 x86），則Windows將僅訪問3.25 GB的RAM。第一個64位處理器是AMD Athlon64。那些x64處理器與較慢的x86軟件和設備完全向後兼容。通過使用x64，消除了4 GB的RAM限制，使我們可以訪問16 GB，32 GB，64 GB或更多的內存。", 'tags': '', 'url': 'PCH5 Processor History 處理器歷史記錄.html'}, {'title': 'PCH5 Virtualization 虛擬化', 'text': 'Virtualization is a wonderful addition to our CPUs. Virtualization is taking the computer world by storm, saving us a ton of money in the process. In the past, if we wanted to run multiple operating systems, we would have to have multiple computers, but not anymore. Using hardware-assisted virtualization, we can enable a host program or host operating system (think a single physical computer) to run one or more guest operating systems (think virtual computers) inside the host OS’s desktop. In the image below, you can see a Macintosh OSX system running Windows in a program window, as well as Ubuntu Linux in another program window. In this example, we have three different operating systems in use on a single computer at the same time. There are many programs that allow this to occur, including the vastly popular commercial program VMWare and the freeware equivalent VirtualBox. 虛擬化是CPU的絕佳補充。虛擬化正在席捲計算機世界，在此過程中為我們節省了大量資金。過去，如果要運行多個操作系統，則必須有多台計算機，但現在不再需要。使用硬件輔助虛擬化，我們可以使主機程序或主機操作系統（例如一台物理計算機）在主機OS的桌面內運行一個或多個來賓操作系統（例如虛擬計算機）。在下圖中，您可以在程序窗口中看到運行Windows的Macintosh OSX系統，以及在另一個程序窗口中運行Ubuntu Linux的系統。在此示例中，我們在同一台計算機上同時使用三種不同的操作系統。有許多程序可以使這種情況發生。 Why would we want to run multiple systems, though? Well, what if you work for a company that only uses a custom program it built for Windows but you own a Macintosh and need to run that program at home? In the old days, you would buy a PC just to run that single program. Now you can just load up a Virtual Windows 7 machine in your Macintosh and run the program. On the server side, servers costs tens of thousands of dollars. If you want to run a small web server, you may not need that type of processing. So, hosting companies can use a single server and provide hundreds of virtual servers on the single server and you pay only a few dollars a month for access. 但是，為什麼我們要運行多個系統？好吧，如果您在一家僅使用為Windows構建的自定義程序但擁有Macintosh並需要在家運行該程序的公司工作，該怎麼辦？在過去，您只需要購買一台PC即可運行該程序。現在，您只需在Macintosh中加載Virtual Windows 7計算機並運行該程序即可。在服務器方面，服務器要花費數万美元。如果要運行小型Web服務器，則可能不需要這種類型的處理。因此，託管公司可以使用單個服務器，並在單個服務器上提供數百個虛擬服務器，您每月只需支付幾美元的訪問費。 Virtualization is continuing to expand and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Many companies and individuals are migrating to the cloud where virtual machines exist without the need for on-premises hardware. In cloud computing, infrastructure to run multiple operating systems or software is purchased from a cloud computing company as a service. 虛擬化正在繼續擴展，並將在可預見的將來繼續擴展。許多公司和個人正在遷移到存在虛擬機而無需內部部署硬件的雲中。在雲計算中，從雲計算公司作為服務購買了運行多個操作系統或軟件的基礎架構。 Integrated Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) 集成圖形處理單元（GPU） The integrated graphics processing unit (GPU) allows for faster video processing, easier access to memory, and an overall lower cost to building a system. The idea is that instead of having a dedicated graphics card that could cost hundreds of dollars, the graphics are instead handled by a dedicated graphics coprocessor inside the CPU (the bottom, smaller chip in the image shown below). These work well for non-3D uses, such as web surfing, office products, DVD and video playback, or low-end games. However, if the system will be used for video/graphic production, computer aided design (CAD), or gaming, a discrete (dedicated) graphics card is more desirable, usually connected by using the PCIe x16 slot on the motherboard. 集成的圖形處理單元（GPU）允許更快的視頻處理，更容易的內存訪問以及總體上較低的構建系統成本。這個想法是，圖形不是由可能花費數百美元的專用圖形卡，而是由CPU內部的專用圖形協處理器（如下圖所示，底部的較小芯片）處理。這些功能非常適合非3D用途，例如網絡衝浪，辦公產品，DVD和視頻播放或低端遊戲。但是，如果將系統用於視頻/圖形製作，計算機輔助設計（CAD）或遊戲，則通常需要使用母板上的PCIe x16插槽進行連接的獨立（專用）圖形卡。 在選擇冷卻系統時，噪音是一個大問題。迄今為止，無源系統是最安靜的，而涉及風扇的有源系統是最嘈雜的。與較大的CPU風扇相比，液冷系統通常使用較小的風扇來冷卻液體，因此，這是一種安靜的冷卻方法，但成本很高。 When deciding on a cooling system, noise is a big concern. Passive systems are the quietest, whereas active systems involving fans are by far the noisiest. A liquid-cooled system often uses a much smaller fan to cool the liquid compared to larger CPU fans, and therefore, it is a quieter cooling method, yet quite expensive. 另一種選擇是使用液體冷卻系統。這是通過將特殊的液體溶液通過計算機泵送到熱交換器中來進行的，在熱交換器中，風扇在循環之前冷卻液體。這些系統僅用於非常高性能的系統和超頻系統，並且安裝和運行起來可能很複雜。 Another option is to use a liquid cooled system. This operates by pumping a special liquid solution through the computer to a heat exchanger, where a fan cools the liquid before recirculation. These systems are only used in very high-performance systems and overclocked systems, and can be complicated to install and run. 在將散熱器連接到CPU之前，技術人員應首先在CPU上塗導熱膏，以幫助熱量從CPU傳遞到金屬散熱器。因此，典型的安裝方法是將CPU放入處理器插槽中，對其進行導熱粘貼，然後將翅片散熱器連接到處理器頂部，最後將專用風扇連接到散熱器頂部。導熱膏是使CPU絕緣的相變材料。糊劑在室溫下為固體，但在較高溫度下變為液體。當變成液體時，它消除了空氣，並提供了更好的絕緣性。 Before connecting the heat sink to the CPU, technicians should first apply thermal paste to the CPU to aid in heat transfer from the CPU to the metal heat sink. Therefore, your typical installation would be to place the CPU in the processor socket, apply thermal paste to it, then connect the finned heat sink to the top of the processor, and finally connect the dedicated fan to the top of the heat sink. A thermal paste is a phase change material that insulates the CPU. The paste is solid at room temperature, but changes to liquid at higher temperatures. When it turns to liquid, it eliminates any air and provides better insulation. 最後，我們需要討論在主板上運行CPU時如何冷卻。有幾種選擇。首先，有一個被動散熱器，它是一個帶有散熱片的金屬設備，可以將熱量從處理器散發出去。這是冷卻CPU的非常安靜的方法。但是，大多數現代CPU產生的熱量太多，僅被動散熱片就無法發揮作用。因此，無源散熱器通常與有源散熱器耦合，在有源散熱器上，專用風扇連接到金屬翅片散熱器的頂部，以更有效地吸收熱量。 Finally, we need to talk about how to cool the CPU when it is running on the motherboard. There are several options. First, there is the passive heat sink, which is a metal device with fins that radiates heat away from the processor. This is a very quiet method of cooling the CPU. However, most modern CPUs generate too much heat for a passive heat sink alone to be effective. Therefore, the passive heat sink is often coupled with an active heat sink, where a dedicated fan is connected to the top of the finned metal heat sink to draw the heat through the heat sink more effectively.', 'tags': '', 'url': 'PCH5 Virtualization 虛擬化.html'}, {'title': 'PCH5 CPU Cooling\xa0 CPU散熱', 'text': 'Finally, we need to talk about how to cool the CPU when it is running on the motherboard.

This connector houses two fibers and mates with locating pins on the plug. These connectors are commonly found connecting a switch to a patch panel, because both devices have a limited area on their front panels. 朗訊連接器（LC）是光纖SC連接器的微型版本。它看上去有點像SC，但尺寸只有一半，只有1.25毫米而不是2.5毫米的插芯，因此在小區域（例如24端口交換機的前面板）連接多個設備時非常有用。 The Lucent connector (LC) is a miniaturized version of the fiber-optic SC connector. It looks somewhat like the SC, but is half the size, with a 1.25 mm ferrule instead of 2.5 mm, making it very useful when connecting multiple devices in a small area, such as on a 24-port switch’s front panel. 筆直（ST）連接器是使用卡口插頭和插座的光纖電纜連接器。它是大多數使用光纖電纜進行商業佈線的第一個事實上的標準連接器，在光纖網絡中非常常見。 The straight tip (ST) connector is a fiber-optic cable connector that uses a bayonet plug and socket. It was the first de facto standard connector for most commercial wiring using fiber cables and it is very commonly found in fiber networks. 用戶連接器（SC）是一種光纖電纜連接器，類似於普通的音頻和視頻電纜，它使用推挽機制鎖入端口。如果要啟用雙向傳輸以發送和接收數據，則需要兩條光纖電纜，因此有時會使用雙SC連接器。 The subscriber connector (SC) is a fiber-optic cable connector that uses a push-pull mechanism to latch into the port, similar to common audio and video cables. If you want to enable bidirectional transmission for sending and receiving data, you need to have two fiber cables, so sometimes a dual SC connector is used. 光纖電纜僅屬於上述兩種類型：單模和多模。但是，每條電纜的末端都有四種。 Fiber cables only come in the two types discussed above: single-mode and multimode. However, the ends of each of these cables come in four varieties. 光纖電纜連接器 Fiber-Optic Cable Connectors 單模光纜（SMF）的芯線比多模光纜小得多。SMF的芯尺寸為10微米。SMF的較小芯線僅允許光從電纜一端到另一端的單一傳播模式。這種直通連接允許數據在沒有中繼器的情況下傳輸的距離比使用MMF傳輸的距離更長。當光線到達目的地時，信號然後被轉換回1和0，並通過網絡接口卡傳遞到計算機。單模光纖通常用於超長距離的光纖連接中，例如從一個局域網到另一個局域網的骨干連接。 Single-mode fiber cables (SMF) contain a much smaller core than the multimode variety. The core size for SMF is 10 microns. SMF’s smaller core only allows for a single mode of travel for the light from one end of the cable to the other. This straight-through connection allows for data to travel longer distances without a repeater than it can travel using MMF. When the light reaches the destination, the signals are then converted back into 1s and 0s and passed to the computer by the network interface card. Single mode fiber is commonly used in very long distance fiber connections, such as a backbone connection from one local area network to another. 多模光纜（MMF）的芯線比單模光纜大。多模光纖的纖芯尺寸為62.5微米。微米是非常小的度量單位，實際上甚至比人類頭髮的寬度還小。MMF的較大芯線實現了從電纜一端到另一端的多種傳播模式。這樣一來，單根光纖就可以在其上傳輸多個信號，而每個信號都以稍微不同的反射角傳輸。當光線到達目的地時，信號然後被轉換回1和0，並通過網絡接口卡傳遞到計算機。多模光纖通常用於較短距離的光纖連接中，例如從路由器到交換機，從交換機到交換機或從服務器到交換機。 Multimode fiber cables (MMF) contain a larger core than the single-mode variety. The core size for a multimode fiber is 62.5 microns. A micron is a very small unit of measurement—it is actually even smaller than the width of a human hair. MMF’s larger core enables multiple modes of travel for the light from one end of the cable to the other. This allows a single fiber to carry multiple signals across it, with each signal being transmitted at a slightly different reflective angle. When the light reaches the destination, the signals are then converted back into 1s and 0s and passed to the computer by the network interface card. Multimode fiber is commonly used in shorter distance fiber connections, such as from a router to a switch, a switch to a switch, or a server to a switch. Fiber-optic cable. Photo used under CC-BY-NC-ND license from \xa0 Craig Rodway . 光纖電纜是通過在電纜的中心使用玻璃芯構成的，該玻璃芯被包層圍繞。為了將數據從電纜的一端發送到另一端，可使用來自發光二極管（LED）或激光的光沿電纜中心的玻璃纖維向下傳輸信號。由於數據是通過光傳輸的，因此不受電磁干擾（EMI）的影響，電磁干擾會影響傳統的銅基電纜，如雙絞線和同軸電纜。光纖具有無需使用中繼器就可以很遠的距離（許多英里）發送數據的能力。由於它們的大帶寬和以光速傳播的信息，它們還可以攜帶大量數據。它們的帶寬可以每秒千兆比特或什至兆兆比特來度量。 Fiber-optic cables are constructed by using a glass core at the center of the cable that is surrounded by cladding. In order to send data from one end of the cable to the other, light from a light-emitting diode (LED) or laser is used to transmit the signal down the glass fiber at the center of the cable. Because the data is being transmitted using light, it is immune to the effects of electromagnetic interference (EMI) that impact traditional copper-based cables, such as twisted pair and coaxial cables. Fiber-optic cables possess the ability to send the data a very far distance (many miles) without the use of a repeater. They also can carry a significant amount of data due to their large bandwidth and the information traveling at light speed. Their bandwidth can be measured in gigabits or even terabits per second. There are two types of fiber cables: multimode and single-mode fiber. 光纖電纜 Fiber-Optic Cable 在本模塊中，我們將討論各種類型的網絡媒體。我們將從光纖電纜開始，然後討論雙絞線電纜和同軸電纜。對於每種電纜類型，我們將討論連接器的外觀，特性和類型，以及速度和限制。 In this module, we’re going to discuss the various types of network media. We will begin with fiber-optic cable and then discuss twisted pair cable and coaxial cable. For each of these cable types, we will discuss appearance, characteristics, and types of connectors, as well as speed and limitations. 總覽 Overview Fiber-Optic Cable Put the steps of a TCP communication session in the correct order. 使用媒體轉換器，您可以將RJ-45連接轉換為ST，SC或LC光纖連接，如下圖所示。然後，將一英里的光纜連接到另一座建築物，並使用媒體轉換器將ST，SC或LC光纖連接轉換回另一台路由器所需的RJ-45。因為這是一個簡單的“啞”設備，所以它僅轉換在第一媒體類型上接收到的所有內容，然後將其重複播放回第二媒體類型。媒體轉換器的常見類型是從以太網（銅）到光纖（然後向後）或從同軸電纜到光纖（然後向後）。 Using a media converter, you can convert your RJ-45 connection into an ST, SC, or LC fiber connection, as shown in the image below. Then, you run the one-mile fiber cable to the other building, and use a media converter to convert from the ST, SC, or LC fiber connection back to the RJ-45 the other router requires. Because this is a simple, “dumb” device, it simply converts whatever is received on the first media type and repeats it back out the second media type. Common types of media converters are from Ethernet (copper) to fiber-optic (and back) or coaxial to fiber-optic (and back). 由於電纜和連接器的類型多種多樣，因此有時需要從一種類型的媒體轉換為另一種類型的媒體。例如，如果您必須在相距一英里的建築物中的兩個LAN之間建立連接，但是您的網絡使用Cat 5e，UTP電纜，那麼如何建立連接？當您查看路由器時，會發現它們僅接受RJ-45連接，但您知道不能將Cat 5e電纜的長度超過100米。您如何解決這個問題？帶媒體轉換器。 Because of the wide variety of cable and connector types, there is sometimes a need to convert from one type of media to another. For example, if you have to make a connection between two LANs in buildings that are located one mile apart, but your network uses Cat 5e, UTP cabling, how can you make that connection? When you look at your routers, you find they only accept RJ-45 connections, but you know that you cannot run a Cat 5e cable more than 100 meters. How can you solve this problem? With a media converter. F型連接器是現代類型的同軸電纜連接器。它通常用於有線電視和電纜調製解調器的連接。通過將連接器擰到帶螺紋的插孔上進行連接以固定連接。 The F-type connector is the modern type of coaxial cable connector. It is typically used for cable TV and cable modem connections. It is connected by screwing the connector onto a threaded jack to secure the connection. 雖然有三種類型的電纜，但同軸電纜僅使用兩種類型的普通連接器。第一個稱為BNC，名稱為刺刀Neill-Concelman。有時人們也將其稱為英國海軍連接器，因為英國人在其艦載無線電系統中大量使用了BNC。該連接器通常用於早期的以太網網絡，並且具有“推壓式”連接器，用於將電纜固定至網絡設備。 While there were three types of cables, there are only two types of common connectors used with coaxial cable. The first is called BNC, from the name Bayonet Neill-Concelman. Sometimes people also call this the British Naval connector, because the BNC was heavily used by the British in their shipboard radio systems. This connector was commonly used in early Ethernet networks and it has a “push and twist” type of connector to secure the cable to the network device. 同軸電纜連接器 Coaxial Cable Connectors 共有三種主要的同軸電纜類型。有線電視公司通常使用RG-6將單個房屋連接到電視網絡。這些電纜很粗，通常用於外部連接以承受天氣的影響。RG-58是一種同軸電纜，在諸如總線和環形拓撲之類的早期10Base2（瘦網）網絡中大量使用。最後，RG-59是傳統的同軸電纜，用於在兩個附近的設備（例如電視和電纜盒）之間傳送複合視頻。如果您是有線Internet用戶，這也可用於將WAN連接從牆壁插孔連接到電纜調製解調器。 There are three dominant coaxial cable types. The RG-6 is commonly used by cable TV companies to connect individual homes to the TV network. These cables are thick and usually used for outside connections to withstand the effects of the weather. The RG-58 is a type of coaxial cable that was heavily used in early 10Base2 (thinnet) networks, such as bus and ring topologies. Finally, the RG-59 is the traditional coaxial cable used to carry composite video between two nearby devices, such as your TV and the cable box. If you are a cable Internet user, this is also used to carry the WAN connection from your wall jack to your cable modem. 同軸電纜類型 Coaxial Cable Types 同軸電纜是一種較老的媒體技術。同軸電纜，也簡稱為同軸電纜，由兩個導體組成。內部導體（稱為絕緣導體（中心線））是在其上傳遞數據的銅線。外導體是編織的金屬屏蔽層，有助於保護內線免受物理傷害和EMI的影響。就像我們在屏蔽雙絞線中看到的屏蔽一樣，外部屏蔽有助於將電磁干擾保持在數據路徑之外。在內部導體和外部屏蔽層之間，我們找到了一個絕緣芯，可防止在內芯和外部屏蔽層之間進行任何數據傳輸。電纜的外部由柔軟的塑料護套製成，非常類似於雙絞線電纜。同軸電纜已包含在第一個以太網標準中，稱為10Base5（Thicknet），並在整個更新中繼續用作10Base2（Thinnet），並且在總線和環形網絡中最常用。但是，UTP電纜更易於在星形拓撲中使用，並且價格便宜得多。 Coaxial cable is a much older media technology. Coaxial cable, also known as coax for short, is composed of two conductors. The inner conductor, which is known as the insulated conductor (center wire), is the copper wire over which data is passed. The outer conductor is the braided metal shield and aids in protecting the inner wire from physical injury and the effects of EMI. Much like the shielding we saw in shielded twisted pair, the outer shield helps keep electromagnetic interference out of the data’s path. Between the inner conductor and the outer shield, we find an insulated core that prevents any data transfer between the inner core and outer shield. The outside of the cable is made of a flexible plastic jacket, much like the twisted pair cabling. Coaxial cabling was included in the first Ethernet standard as 10Base5 (thicknet) and continued to be used throughout updates as 10Base2 (thinnet) as well as being most commonly used in bus and ring networks. UTP cabling however, is easier to work with in a star topology and is significantly less expensive. 直通電纜是雙絞線電纜的一種，在局域網中用於將計算機連接到網絡集線器（例如路由器）。此類電纜有時也稱為跳線。電纜的兩端都具有相同的引出線，因此名稱為“直通”。交叉電纜切換電纜兩端的引腳分配，使發送和接收引腳在兩端交替。這允許兩個工作站直接相互連接，而無需集線器，交換機或路由器。 A straight-through cable is a type of twisted pair cable that is used in local area networks to connect a computer to a network hub, such as a router. This type of cable is also sometimes called a patch cable. Both ends of the cable have an identical pinout, hence the name “straight-through.” A crossover cable switches the pinouts of the two ends of the cable, making the transmit and receive pins alternate on the two ends. This allows two workstations to connect directly to each other without the need for a hub, switch, or router. 最後，DB-9連接器用於RS-232信號。該連接器看起來像標準的串行連接器。它通常用於異步串行通信，例如連接到外部調製解調器。在現代網絡中，您將在“翻轉電纜”上看到這種類型的連接器。翻轉電纜的一側為DB-9（連接到筆記本電腦的串行端口），另一側為RJ-45連接器（用於連接到Cisco路由器和交換機以執行管理任務）。 Finally, the DB-9 connector is used for RS-232 signals. This connector looks like a standard serial connector. It is used commonly for asynchronous serial communications, like connecting to an external modem. In modern networks, you will see this type of connector on a “rollover cable.” A rollover cable has a DB-9 on one side (which is connected to your laptop’s serial port), and an RJ-45 connector on the other side (which is used to connect to Cisco routers and switches to do administration tasks). RJ-11連接器用於標準電話系統。RJ-11是一個六針連接器，但電話通常僅使用兩個針（發送和接收）。如果您有兩線電話，則使用四個引腳：兩個引腳用於發送，兩個引腳用於接收。 The RJ-11 connector is used in the standard telephone system. The RJ-11 is a six-pin connector, but commonly only two pins are used for a telephone (transmit and receive). If you have a two-line phone, then four pins are used: two pins to transmit and two pins to receive. 雙絞線電纜帶有三種主要類型的連接器。第一個是RJ-45連接器，它是以太網網絡中使用的八針連接器。即使大多數以太網僅使用四個引腳，RJ-45仍提供八個引腳以供將來使用和使用。前四個引腳用於發送（兩個引腳）和接收（兩個引腳）。 Twisted pair cables come with three main types of connectors. The first is the RJ-45 connector, which is an eight-pin connector used in Ethernet networks. Even though most Ethernet networks use only four pins, the RJ-45 provides eight pins for future use and capabilities. The first four pins are used to transmit (two pins) and receive (two pins). 雙絞線連接器 Twisted Pair Connectors       類別   最大吞吐量   局域網應用       3   10Mbps   10BaseT;\xa0不推薦使用100BaseT4       5   100Mbps   10/100 / 1000BaseT100 / 1000BaseTX       5e   1Gbps（1000Mbps）   10/100 / 1000BaseT100 / 1000BaseTX       6   1Gbps（1000Mbps）   10/100 / 1000BaseT100 / 1000BaseTX10GBaseT       6a   10Gbps   10/100 / 1000BaseT100 / 1000 / BaseTX10GBaseT       7   10Gbps   10/100 / 1000BaseT100 / 1000 / BaseTX10GBaseT             Category   Maximum Throughput   LAN Application       Cat 3   10Mbps   10BaseT; 100BaseT4deprecated       Cat 5   100Mbps   10/100/1000BaseT100/1000BaseTX       Cat 5e   1Gbps (1000Mbps)   10/100/1000BaseT100/1000BaseTX       Cat 6   1Gbps (1000Mbps)   10/100/1000BaseT100/1000BaseTX10GBaseT       Cat 6a   10Gbps   10/100/1000BaseT100/1000/BaseTX10GBaseT       Cat 7   10Gbps   10/100/1000BaseT100/1000/BaseTX10GBaseT         直至Cat 5e和Cat 6a為止的所有電纜類別的最大距離為100米。在10GBaseT中使用時，類別6的最大距離為55米。Cat 7被屏蔽並超過了100米的限制。隨著電纜類別的增加，每英寸的捻數和頻率範圍也會增加，從而可以提供更多的數據並改善對EMI的保護。銅纜佈線的最佳實踐是 不要 使電纜長度最大，因為衰減會降低數據容量。 All cable categories up to cat 5e and cat 6a have a maximum distance of 100 meters. When used in 10GBaseT, the maximum distance for cat 6 is 55 meters. Cat 7 is shielded and exceeds the 100 meter limit. As the category of the cable increases, so do the number of twists per inch and the frequency range, allowing for more data and improved protection against EMI. Best practice for copper cabling is\xa0 not\xa0 to run cable lengths to the maximum because attenuation will reduce data capacity. 當在10GBaseT中使用時，Cat 6a克服了Cat 6的37-55米的限制。最新標準Cat 7被屏蔽，並提供高達10 Gbps的連接，最大距離為100米。“ Cat 7和Cat 7a電纜將用於數據中心內服務器之間的主干連接”，並且“提供在數據中心內使用光纖電纜的替代方法”（來自http://www.cablestogo.com/learning/library/data-center/cat7-overview）。 Cat 6a overcomes the 37-55 meter limitation of cat 6 when used in 10GBaseT. Cat 7, the newest standard, is shielded and provides connections up to 10 Gbps with a maximum distance of 100 meters. “Cat 7 and cat 7a cabling will be used for backbone connections between servers within a data center” and “provide an alternative to using fiber-optic cabling within the data center” (fromhttp://www.cablestogo.com/learning/library/data-center/cat7-overview). 為此原因，Cat 5電纜是對較舊的Cat 3電纜的改進，並包含更多的絞合線，從而使它們具有更大的EMI屏蔽能力，最大帶寬為100 Mbps。Cat 5e或Cat 5增強後，將最大吞吐量的速度提高到1 Gbps或1000 Mbps，並成為了空白，直到Cat 6電纜變得司空見慣。 Cat 5 cables were an improvement on the older cat 3 cables and contain more twists, giving them more shielding from EMI and a maximum bandwidth of 100 Mbps. Cat 5e, or cat 5 enhanced, increased the speed of the maximum throughput to one Gbps, or 1000 Mbps, and became a gap filler until cat 6 cabling became commonplace. 雙絞線電纜根據類別（類別）編號進行分類。例如，類別3（或類別3）是我們使用的最古老的電纜類型。它是在1980年代和1990年代引入的，用於第一批星形拓撲。Cat 3電纜的最大吞吐量或帶寬僅為10 Mbps（兆位/秒）。與所有雙絞線電纜一樣，如果不使用中繼器，交換機或有源集線器來放大信號，則Cat 3不能走超過100米。這種有限的距離歸因於這些電纜中的銅線。當信號在銅線上傳輸時，導線的自然電阻會降低信號的強度，並且最終變得太弱而無法接收遠端。 Twisted pair cable is categorized based on a category (cat) number. For example, cat 3, or category 3, is the oldest type of cable that we use. It was introduced back in the 1980s and 1990s for use in the first star topologies. The maximum throughput or bandwidth of cat 3 cabling is only 10 Mbps (megabits per second). The cat 3, like all twisted pair cabling, cannot go farther than 100 meters without using a repeater, switch, or active hub to amplify the signal. This limited distance is attributable to the copper wiring in these cables. As the signal travels over the copper wire, the natural resistance to the wire decreases the signal’s strength, and it eventually becomes too weak for the distant end to receive. For this reason, there is a 100 meter limitation when building and designing a twisted pair network. 分類雙絞線電纜 電纜的最常見類型是非屏蔽雙絞線電纜。該電纜不使用額外的屏蔽，而是依靠其銅線對的絞合來最大程度地減小EMI的影響。每個雙絞線都經過絞合，以使其自身與其他雙絞線絕緣，並且由於沒有額外的屏蔽，因此可以以比STP更低的成本獲得。因此，UTP是小型辦公室，家庭辦公室，住宅和許多商業網絡的最常見選擇媒體。 The more common type of cabling is unshielded twisted pair cable. Instead of using extra shielding, this cable relies on the twisting of its copper pairs to minimize the effects of EMI. Each twisted pair is twisted to insulate itself from the other pairs, and because there is no additional shielding, it is available at a lower cost than STP. Therefore, UTP is the most common media of choice for small office, home office, residential, and many commercial networks. 屏蔽雙絞線電纜的構造與非屏蔽雙絞線非常相似，不同之處在於，成對的電線也被金屬屏蔽層（如金屬箔）圍繞。外部箔屏蔽層可最大程度地減小電纜所遭受的EMI。這增加了電纜的安全性和可靠性。但是，不幸的是，這也增加了電纜的成本，因此通常僅在高生產環境中使用，在這種環境中，額外的安全性值得額外的成本。 Shielded twisted pair cable is built very similarly to unshielded twisted pair, except that the pairs of wires are also surrounded by a metallic shielding (like foil). This outer foil shielding minimizes the EMI to which the cable is exposed. This increases the security and reliability of the cable. Unfortunately, however, this also increases the cost of the cable, so it is typically used only in high-production environments where the extra security is worth the extra cost. 儘管光纜在速度，距離和安全性方面都非常出色，但在大多數網絡中尚未普及。相反，我們仍在使用過去兩到三十年來一直使用的相同類型的電纜-雙絞線。雙絞線電纜是當今世界上最流行的物理LAN介質。每條電纜包含四對獨立絕緣的銅線。每對絞合在一起以最大程度地減少電磁干擾（EMI）。電纜中的扭曲越多，EMI越小。雙絞線分為兩種類型：非屏蔽雙絞線（UTP）和屏蔽雙絞線（STP）。 While fiber-optic cable is great for its speed, distance, and security, it hasn’t yet become commonplace in most networks. Instead, we are still using the same type of cabling we have been using for the past two to three decades — twisted pair. Twisted pair cable is the most popular physical LAN media in the world today. Each cable contains four pairs of individually insulated strands of copper wire. Each pair is twisted together to minimize the amount of electromagnetic interference (EMI). The more twists there are in the cable, the less EMI there will be. Twisted pair cable is broken up into two types: unshielded twisted pair (UTP) and shielded twisted pair (STP). 雙絞線', 'tags': '', 'url': '40923230黃暐哲-1.html'}, {'title': 'UNIT1 Succeeding in PC Hardware', 'text': 'PC Hardware is an online course, where the content will be presented in the form of both text and activities. \xa0\xa0 PC Hardware是一門線上的課程，其中的內容將以文本和活動的形式呈現。 While you will have more flexibility than in a traditional course, you will also have more responsibility for your own learning.

We will also discuss the variety of power sources a notebook has access to, including its battery, AC adapter, and docking stations. Next, we will discuss the proper disposal procedures that should be used when someone upgrades or breaks their notebook. Finally, we will discuss the physical security of notebooks. We will look at the construction of these devices, as well as the proper installation of the security cable and how it is connected to the notebook. 在筆記型電腦上的模塊中，我們會討論筆記型電腦和筆記型電腦中使用的各種不同類型的電池，以及電池結構，電池維護和各種電量的指示器。我們還會討論筆記型電腦可以使用的各種電源，包括電池，AC適配器和擴展塢。再來，我們又會討論當有人升級或破壞筆記型電腦時應使用的正確的處理順序。最後，我們會討論筆記型的物理安全性。我們也會研究這些設備的結構，安全電纜的正確安裝以及如何將他們連接到筆記型電腦。 Battery Types\xa0\xa0 電池類型 Laptops and notebooks can receive power from several different types of batteries. The batteries are used to provide direct current (DC) to your notebook, and the batteries are then recharged by the alternating current (AC) adapter that connects your notebook to the wall outlet. The AC adapter actually works as a transformer, converting the wall outlet’s high-voltage AC into low-voltage DC that your notebook uses to charge its battery. 筆記型電腦和筆記型電腦可以透過很多種不同類型的電池提供電源。 電池用於筆記型電腦提供直流（DC），然後再透過將筆記本電腦連接至牆上插座的交流（AC）適配器為電池充電。 交流適配器實際上充當變壓器，將牆壁裝電源插座的高壓AC轉換為筆記本計算機用來為其電池充電的低壓DC。 The notebook battery is an enclosed plastic casing with individual battery cells on the inside, as shown in the images above. Older notebooks used either nickel-cadmium (NiCd or NiCad) or nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) batteries. These types of batteries are seldom used in modern notebooks and laptops because they suffered from what is termed the “memory effect.” Basically, the “memory effect” occurs when a battery loses its capacity to fully recharge if it is discharged repeatedly the same amount and then recharged without being fully drained first. For example, if every time your notebook battery’s charge was at 20 percent you went and recharged it, then 20 percent charge would become the new zero for your battery, reducing the overall charge available to only 80 percent of the original capacity. 筆記型電腦的電池是一個封閉的塑料外殼，內部裝有單個電池，如上圖所示。 較舊的筆記型電腦使用鎳鎘（NiCd或NiCad）或鎳氫（NiMH）電池。 這些類型的電池很少用於現代的筆記型電腦，因為它們受到了所謂的“記憶效應”。 基本上，如果反覆放電相同量的電池而失去其完全充電的能力，則發生“記憶效應”，然後先充電而又沒有完全耗盡。 例如，如果你每次筆記型電池的電量為20％時都要去充電，那麼20％的電量將成為電池的0％，從而將總可用電量減少到原始容量的80％。 Both of these battery types were replaced with lithium-ion batteries. The lithium-ion batteries do not suffer from the memory effect issue. They perform better than other types of batteries, and are lighter in weight, which increases a notebook’s mobility. Lithium-ion batteries also feature a rapid-charging option that allows faster charging when the user is in a hurry. These batteries are more environmentally friendly than the previous types, as well. 這兩種電池都被鋰離子電池取代。 鋰離子電池不會受到記憶效應問題。 它們的性能比其他類型的電池更好，而且重量更輕，這增加了筆記本的移動性。 鋰離子電池還具有快速充電選項，當用戶急忙時可以更快地充電。 這些電池也比以前的電池更環保。 To best care for your notebook or laptop, always use the approved battery type for your model. Using unapproved batteries in your notebook can lead to the notebook catching fire or exploding. In order to maintain notebook batteries at peak operating efficiency, keep the batteries at room temperature and avoid heat. If your notebook has a full charge and is subjected to high temperatures, the longevity of your battery will decrease. Batteries deteriorate over time, so purchase one with the most recent manufacturing date for the longest life. Also, getting a higher-capacity battery will provide a longer battery life on a given charge. Since lithium-ion batteries do not have a memory effect, it is often better to use partial-discharge cycles for notebooks and laptops that use those batteries. Note, while there is no memory effect, some lithium-ion batteries suffer from a “digital memory” that decreases the accuracy of the power gauge. To recalibrate the power gauge, you need to fully discharge the battery routinely, such as every few months, then completely recharge it. Lastly, if you are planning on storing your notebook for a while, it is best to discharge the battery to about 50 percent first, then store it in a cool, dry place. This will prolong the life of the battery and prevent you from having to waste money on a replacement. 為了最好地保護筆記型電腦，必須常常為你的型號使用認可的電池類型。 在筆記型電腦中使用未經許可的電池可能會導致筆記本計算機著火或爆炸。 為了使筆記型電腦的電池保持最高工作效率，請將電池保持在室溫下並避免發熱。 如果你的筆記型電腦充滿電並且處於高溫下，則電池的壽命會降低。 電池會隨著時間的經過而變質，因此請購買製造日期離最近的電池以延長使用壽命。 同樣地，在給定的電量下，使用容量更大的電池將提供更長的電池壽命。 由於鋰離子電池沒有記憶效應，因此對於使用這些電池的筆記型電腦，最好使用部分放電循環。 注意， 雖然沒有記憶效應，但是一些鋰離子電池會受到“數字記憶”的困擾，這會降低功率計的精度。 要重新校準功率計，你需要定期（例如每幾個月一次）對電池完全放電，然後將其完全充電。 最後，如果你打算將筆記型電腦存放一段時間，則最好先將電池放電約50％，然後將其存放在陰涼乾燥的地方。 這樣可以延長電池壽命，並可以避免你在更換電池時浪費金錢。 然後完全充電。 The amount of battery life is indicated in a number of ways in a notebook, depending on the computer model. All modern operating systems provide a digital gauge inside the operating system. This indication can be set by the user to show either the percentage of battery life remaining (such as 53 percent left), the time remaining until the battery runs out (such as 1 hour, 43 minutes to empty), or the time to full charge (such as 34 minutes to full charge). Some models of batteries, though, have a battery gauge included on the battery itself. This will use a scale, such as five circles that will light up to show the remaining life of the battery. 根據筆記型電腦的型號，筆記型電腦可以透過很多種方式指示電池壽命。 所有現代操作系統都在操作系統內部提供數字量規。 用戶可以設置此指示以顯示剩餘電池壽命百分比（例如剩餘53％），直到電池用完的剩餘時間（例如1小時43分鐘用完）或充滿時間充電（例如充滿電需要34分鐘）。 但是，某些型號的電池在電池本身中附帶一個電池電量計。 這將會使用一個刻度，例如五個圓圈，它將點亮以顯示電池的剩餘壽命。 AC Power\xa0交流電源 As previously stated, the battery is used to provide direct current to your notebook and the battery is then recharged by the AC adapter that connects your laptop to the wall outlet. While the battery directly powers the notebook’s components, much like a power supply in a desktop, the battery doesn’t perform any transformation of the power it receives or sends out. These functions are handled by the AC adapter. Many docking stations provide the ability to either use the regular AC adapter as their power source, or use a built-in AC adapter to perform the transformation of the power from AC to DC. If the laptop is using a docking station, it still uses the battery to provide power to the laptop, and the docking station to charge the laptop’s battery. A\xa0 port replicator \xa0 , on the other hand, requires the AC adapter to perform the transformation for it. 如前所述，電池用於向筆記型電腦提供直流電，然後通過將筆記型電腦連接至牆上插座的交流適配器為電池充電。儘管電池可以直接為筆記型電腦的組件提供電，就像台式機中的電源一樣，但電池不會對其接收或發出的功率進行任何轉換。這些功能由交流適配器處理。許多擴展塢都可以使用常規的AC適配器作為電源，也可以使用內置的AC適配器執行從AC到DC的電源轉換。如果方便攜帶筆記型電腦正在使用擴展塢，它仍將使用電池為便攜式計算機供電，並使用擴展塢為便攜式計算機的電池充電。一個 \xa0 端口復制器 \xa0 而另一方面，要求AC適配器為其執行轉換。 Docking stations are used to add capabilities to a laptop and create a "desktop" experience. For example, in the image above, you can see that the docking station has numerous USB ports, a PS/2 port for keyboard/mouse, a modem port, Ethernet port, VGA and DVI display outputs, audio input and output ports, as well as serial and parallel connections. Some docking stations even have built-in hard drives and optical drives for additional storage. A port replicator, on the other hand, only provides the same ports that already exist on the laptop. This is used for quick connection and disconnection to the various external devices when the laptop is returned to the office environment. 擴展塢用於筆記型電腦添加功能並創建“桌面”體驗。例如，在上圖中，你可以看到擴展塢具有多個USB端口，一個用於鍵盤/鼠標的PS / 2端口，一個調製解調器端口，以太網端口，VGA和DVI顯示輸出，音頻輸入和輸出端口，如以及串行和並行連接。某些擴展塢甚至具有內置硬盤驅動器和光盤驅動器，用於額外存儲。另一方面，端口復制器僅提供筆記本電腦上已經存在的相同端口。當筆記型電腦返回辦公環境時，可用於快速連接和斷開與各種外部設備的連接。 Proper Disposal Procedures\xa0正確的處置程序 Rechargeable laptop batteries contain hazardous materials such as mercury, cadmium, and lead. Many states have laws governing the disposal of batteries containing toxic materials. Often disposing of them in the trash and sending them to a landfill is illegal. Recycling, sometimes referred to as eCycling in the case of computers and other electronics, reduces the amount of toxic elements entering the waste stream and is often the required or preferred disposal method. Recycling saves landfill space, conserves our natural resources, and reduces the amount of electronic waste generated by residents in the state. For example, according to the State of Maryland, eCycling reduces more than 150,000 tons of waste every year. Local regulations (state, county, or city) dictate the proper methods of disposing of the physical laptop and its components. 筆記型電腦可以充電電池包含有害物質，例如汞，鎘和鉛。 許多的州都有管理含毒物質電池處置的法律。 通常，將它們丟棄在垃圾桶中並送到垃圾填埋場是非法的。 回收，有時在計算機和其他電子設備中稱為“循環”，可減少進入廢物流的有毒元素的數量，這些通常是必需或首選的處置方法。 回收利用可節省垃圾填埋場的空間，節約我們的自然資源，並減少該州居民產生的電子廢物量。 例如，據馬里蘭州稱，電子騎車每年可減少15萬噸以上的廢物。 當地法規（州，縣或市）規定了處置物理筆記型電腦及其組件的正確方法。 If, instead of disposing of the entire laptop, you wish to sell the device, you should first remove your personal information from the laptop. The best way to do this is to perform a hard drive format using overwrite software. This is also known as a “secure erase,” where every portion of the hard disk is rewritten with a “0” in order to fully clear your personal data from the device. Then, if necessary, you can reinstall the operating system and sell the device. 如果你想出售設備而不是丟棄整個筆記型電腦，則應該首先從筆記型電腦中刪除個人訊息。 最好的方法是使用覆蓋軟體執行硬盤驅動器格式。 這也稱為“安全擦除”，其中硬碟的每個部分都用“ 0”重寫，以便從設備中完全清除你的個人數據。 然後，如果有必要，你可以重新安裝操作系統並出售設備。 Security\xa0安全 Security cables are used to ensure that laptops are not physically removed from a particular area. Security cables are constructed much like a bicycle security lock, with a thick, carbon strengthened steel or metal cable that has a loop on one end and a lock on the other. The lock end has a T-shaped head that is inserted into the Kensington security slot on the computer (named after the first company to produce these locks). The locks are set using either a key or a combination-style lock. The other end, with the loop, can then be secured to a stationary device, like a pole or the desk itself. Often, these are installed by looping the lock end through the loop end, as it goes around a portion of the desk, securing the security lock to a location on the desk. Some security cables also have an audible alarm feature that alerts when someone tries to force the lock. Remember that these physical security measures only work when used properly. Tether a laptop to a strong, unbreakable, non-movable object. 安全電纜適用於確定未從特定區域物理移除便筆記型電腦。 安全纜線的結構很像自行車安全鎖，由一根粗的碳增強的鋼或金屬纜線組成，該纜線的一端有一個環，另一端有一個鎖。 鎖端有一個T形頭，該頭插入計算機上的Kensington安全插槽（以生產這些鎖的第一家公司的名字命名）。 可以使用鑰匙或組合鎖來設置鎖。 然後可以將帶有環的另一端固定到固定裝置，例如桿子或桌子本身。 通常，通過將鎖端繞在桌子的一部分周圍，將鎖端穿過環形端進行安裝，從而將安全鎖固定到桌子上的某個位置，從而進行安裝。 一些安全電纜還具有聲音警報功能，當有人試圖強行鎖定時會發出警報。 請記住，這些物理安全措施只有在正確使用後才能起作用。 將筆記本電腦系在堅固，不可移動的物體上。', 'tags': '', 'url': 'UNIT1 Succeeding in PC Hardware.html'}, {'title': '40923223游尚霖-1', 'text': 'Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9).

In Python, these formally-distributed code packages are called \xa0 modules . The thing we want from a module in this exercise is the ability to generate random numbers. This comes from the \xa0 random \xa0 module. To use a module, at the top of your file, type \t import   random This means you are allowing your Python program to use a module called \xa0 random \xa0 in the rest of your code. To use it (and generate a random integer), now type: \t a   =   random . randint ( 2 ,   6 ) Once you run this program, the variable \xa0 a \xa0 will have a random integer that the computer made for you, between 2 and 6 (including 2 and 6). The specific documentation for this method is \xa0 here . 隨機數（和模塊） 這是您第一次使用別人編寫的Python代碼。在Python中，這些正式分發的代碼包稱為 modules 。在本練習中，我們希望從模塊獲得的是生成隨機數的能力。這來自 隨機 模塊。 要使用模塊，請在文件頂部鍵入 \t import   random 這意味著您允許Python程序使用 random 在其餘代碼中調用的模塊。 要使用它（並生成一個隨機整數），現在鍵入： \t a   =   random . randint ( 2 ,   6 ) 一旦運行此程序，該變量 a 將具有計算機為您生成的隨機整數，介於2到6之間（包括2到6）。此方法的特定文檔 在此處 。 解答 import random    隨機 導入 \n\nnumber = random.randint(1,9) 數字   =   隨機 數 。 randint （ 1 ， 9 ） \nguess = 0\ncount = 0\n\n\nwhile guess != number and guess != "exit": 而   猜測   ！=   數字   和   猜測   ！=    “退出” ： \n    guess = input("What\'s your guess?")   猜測   =   輸入 （ “您的猜測是什麼？” ） \n    \n    if guess == "exit":   如果   猜測   ==    “退出” ： \n        break\n    \n    guess = int(guess)\n    count += 1\n    \n    if guess < number:如果猜的小於數字\n        print("Too low!")打印出太小     elif guess > number:\n        print("Too high!")   \n    else:其他\n        print("You got it!")   打印 （ “您知道了！” ） \n        print("And it only took you",count,"tries!")   打印 （ “只花了你” ， 數數 ， “嘗試！” ）    a   =   [ 1 ,   1 ,   2 ,   3 ,   5 ,   8 ,   13 ,   21 ,   34 ,   55 ,   89 ]   Instead of printing the elements one by one, make a new list that has all the elements less than 5 from this list in it and print out this new list.   Write this in one line of Python.   Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements from the original list \xa0 a \xa0 that are smaller than that number given by the user.拿一個清單，例如說一個：a = [1、2、3、5、8、13、21、34、55、89] 並編寫一個程序，打印出列表中小於5的所有元素。附加功能：而不是一個一個地打印元素，而是創建一個新列表，其中該列表中的所有元素少於5個，然後打印出該新列表。 用一行Python編寫。 向用戶詢問一個數   ListsThis week’s exercise hits on a topic critical for all types and styles of programming: \xa0 lists . Lists are basically an ordered way of grouping things (called \xa0 elements ) - the cool thing about lists in Python is that you can have a list that contains objects of multiple types. Your list can mix between strings, integers, objects, other lists, what have you.The way to construct an empty list is just to do\n x   =   [] \nAnd your variable \xa0 x \xa0 now holds an empty list. To add things to this list, just “append” them to the list. Like so:\n x   =   [] \n x . append ( 3 ) \nYour list \xa0 x \xa0 now looks like \xa0 [3] .In Python, lists are also \xa0 iterables , which means you can loop through them with a \xa0 for loop \xa0 in a convenient way. (If you come from other languages like C++ or Java you are most likely used to using a counter to loop through indices of a list - in Python you can actually loop through the elements.) I will let the code speak for itself:\n my_list   =   [ 1 ,   3 ,   "Michele" ,   [ 5 ,   6 ,   7 ]] \n for   element   in   my_list : \n   print ( element ) \nWill yield the result:\n 1 \n3\n"Michele"\n[5, 6, 7] \nThere are many other properties of lists, but for the basic exercise all you should need is this for loop property. Future weeks will address other properties of lists.For more information about lists in Python, check out these resources:\n   The official Python documentation on lists   Tutorialspoint on Python lists   Someone else’s blog post about lists   \nMore ConditionalsThe nice thing about conditionals is that they follow logical operations. They can also be used to test equality. Let’s do a small example. Let’s say I want to make a piece of code that converts from a numerical grade (1-100) to a letter grade (A, B, C, D, F). The code would look like this:\n grade   =   input ( "Enter your grade: " ) \n if   grade   >=   90 : \n   print ( "A" ) \n elif   grade   >=   80 : \n   print ( "B" ) \n elif   grade   >=   70 : \n   print ( "C" ) \n elif   grade   >=   65 : \n   print ( "D" ) \n else : \n   print ( "F" ) \nWhat happens if \xa0 grade \xa0 is 50? All the conditions are false, so \xa0 "F" \xa0 gets printed on the screen. But what if \xa0 grade \xa0 is 95? Then all the conditions are true and everything gets printed, right? Nope! What happens is the program goes line by line. The first condition (grade >= 90) is satisfied, so the program enters into the code inside the \xa0 if \xa0 statement, executing \xa0 print("A") . Once code inside a conditional has been executed, the rest of the conditions are skipped and none of the other conditionals are checked.清單 本週的練習涉及一個對所有類型和風格的編程都至關重要的主題：列表。列表基本上是一種將事物（稱為元素）進行分組的有序方式-Python中列表的最酷的功能是您可以擁有一個包含多種類型對象的列表。您的列表可以混合在字符串，整數，對象，其他列表之間，包括您所擁有的。構造一個空列表的方法就是x = [] 現在，變量x包含一個空列表。要將內容添加到此列表中，只需將它們“添加”到列表中即可。像這樣：x = [] x.append（3） 您的列表x現在看起來像[3]。在Python中，列表也是可迭代的，這意味著您可以方便地使用for循環遍歷它們。 （如果您來自其他語言，例如C ++或Java，則最有可能習慣於使用計數器循環遍歷列表的索引-在Python中，您實際上可以循環遍曆元素。）我將讓代碼說明自己：my_list = [1，3，“米歇爾”，[5，6，7]] 對於my_list中的元素： 打印（元素） 將產生結果：1個 3 “米歇爾” [5，6，7] 列表還有許多其他屬性，但是對於基本練習而言，您只需要此for循環屬性。未來幾週將處理列表的其他屬性。有關Python中列表的更多信息，請查看以下資源：列表中的官方Python文檔 Python清單上的Tutorialspoint 他人關於列表的博客文章 更多條件 關於條件的好處是它們遵循邏輯運算。它們也可以用於測試相等性。讓我們舉一個小例子。假設我要編寫一段代碼，將數字等級（1-100）轉換為字母等級（A，B，C，D，F）。代碼如下所示：成績=輸入（“輸入您的成績：”） 如果成績> = 90： 打印（“ A”） elif等級> = 80： 打印（“ B”） elif等級> = 70： 打印（“ C”） elif等級> = 65： 打印（“ D”） 其他： 打印（“ F”） 如果年級是50，會發生什麼？所有條件都為假，因此“ F”被打印在屏幕上。但是，如果成績是95，該怎麼辦？然後所有條件都成立，一切都打印出來了，對吧？不！程序將逐行執行。滿足第一個條件（等級> = 90），因此程序將在if語句內輸入代碼，並執行print（“ A”）。一旦執行了條件語句中的代碼，將跳過其餘條件，並且不檢查其他條件。！   x   =   [] x   =   [] \n x . append ( 3 ) my_list   =   [ 1 ,   3 ,   "Michele" ,   [ 5 ,   6 ,   7 ]] \n for   element   in   my_list : \n   print ( element ) 1 \n3\n"Michele"\n[5, 6, 7]   The official Python documentation on lists   Tutorialspoint on Python lists   Someone else’s blog post about lists   grade   =   input ( "Enter your grade: " ) \n if   grade   >=   90 : \n   print ( "A" ) \n elif   grade   >=   80 : \n   print ( "B" ) \n elif   grade   >=   70 : \n   print ( "C" ) \n elif   grade   >=   65 : \n   print ( "D" ) \n else : \n   print ( "F" )    open_file   =   open ( \'file_to_save.txt\' ,   \'w\' )儲存文件 用寫入的方式 \n   open_file . write ( \'A string to write\' )寫入文字到文件 \n   open_file . close ()把打開的檔案關掉   Open the web page in Chrome.

We will also introduce the safety measures and procedures that must be used to minimize risks, such as the use of ESD straps, ESD mats, self-grounding systems and equipment grounding. Then, we will discuss personal safety, including removing jewelry to protect yourself and the computer, proper lifting techniques and weight restrictions, and removing power. Finally, we will introduce electrical fire safety 本課程涵蓋了基本程序和安全預防措施，技術人員在使用各種PC硬件之前必須具備一定的能力和舒適度。 首先，我們將討論計算機系統和工具的危害，包括電，靜電釋放（ESD），化學物質以及在使用各種形式的計算機硬件時可能傷害您的其他危害。 我們還將介紹必須使用的安全措施和規程，以最大程度地降低風險，例如使用ESD帶，ESD墊，自接地系統和設備接地。 然後，我們將討論人身安全，包括為保護自己和計算機而移走珠寶，適當的舉陞技術和重量限制以及移去電源。 最後，我們將介紹電氣消防安全 Working in the United States, you should expect to receive a voltage of 115 VAC to 120 VAC (AC voltage) from an office or home power outlet. You can use a simple three-prong tester, voltmeter or multimeter to verify. In the procedure, do not pull the wire out of the wire, as this will cause damage and fraying of the cable. Instead, you should insert the plug and pull out the cable through the plug at the end of the power cord. In addition to protecting their own safety, technicians also need to protect computers from electrical damage. Surge protectors are usually used to protect computers from power spikes or power surges. Switchboards and surge protectors are not the same thing. The rated power unit of the surge protector is Joule (J). The rating indicates the number of joules that the surge protector can absorb before it fails. The higher the rating, the higher the protection of the computer. In addition, you must not overload surge protectors, or daisy-chain them, and you must not plug a surge protector into another surge protector: this will cause higher amperage consumption, which can lead to Fire. The above article told me that the difference between ups and sps includes an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages, and finally told me what to use to stabilize the voltage 上面的文章告訴我ups和sps的差別包含優缺點的分析,最後跟我說要使用什麼來穩定電壓 操作程序：電氣安全 在美國工作，則應該期望從辦公室或家庭的電源插座接收到115 VAC至120 VAC（交流電壓）的電壓。可以使用簡單的三叉測試儀，電壓表或萬用表進行驗證。程序上，切勿將電線從電線中拉出，因為這會導致電纜損壞和磨損。相反，您應該插入插頭並通過電源線末端的插頭拔出電纜。 除了保護自己的安全外，技術人員還需要保護計算機免受電氣損壞。 通常使用電湧保護器來保護計算機免受電源尖峰或電湧的影響。 配電盤與電湧保護器不是一回事。 電湧保護器的額定功率單位為焦耳（J）。 額定值表示電湧保護器在故障之前可以吸收的焦耳數。 額定值越高，表示對計算機的保護越高。 另外，您一定不能使電湧保護器過載，也不能以菊花鏈的方式將它們電擊，也不能將一個電湧保護器插入另一個電湧保護器：這會導致更高的安培數消耗，從而引發火災。 When working with a computer, the largest amount of voltage you will find is located inside the computer’s power supply unit (PSU). You should\xa0 never \xa0 disassemble a PSU; when it is broken, simply replace the entire unit. Power supply units are relatively inexpensive, so it is a best practice to simply replace them. Some technicians wonder why they should not disassemble or open the PSU and try to fix it, but the reason is simple — it is \xa0 very \xa0 dangerous. A PSU has numerous electrical components that allow it to convert the high-voltage 115-120 VAC (or 230-240 VAC) power into the 12 VDC (volts direct current) that is usable by the computer. Some of these components are capacitors, which cause the power supply to retain lots of voltage (up to 10,000 volts or more) even after the computer is turned off and even after the computer and PSU are unplugged. Therefore, if you want to see the inside of a PSU, search for it on the Internet and look at a picture. It is much safer. 使用計算機時，您將發現的最大電壓位於計算機的電源設備（PSU）內部。您 切勿 \xa0 拆卸電源設備；損壞時，只需更換整個單元。電源設備價格相對便宜，因此最好是簡單地更換它們。一些技術人員想知道為什麼不應該拆卸或打開PSU並嘗試對其進行修復，但是原因很簡單-它 非常 \xa0 危險的。PSU具有許多電氣組件，可將115-120 VAC（或230-240 VAC）高壓電源轉換為計算機可使用的12 VDC（直流電壓）。這些組件中的一些是電容器，即使在關閉計算機後以及拔下計算機和PSU的電源後，電源也會保持大量電壓（最高10,000伏或更高）。因此，如果要查看PSU的內部，請在Internet上搜索並查看圖片。這更安全。 計算機電源。 由 cand3la 根據CC-BY-NC許可使用 From this chapter, I can know that if you want uninterrupted power supply, you can use ups, and if you can turn on psu, you will be electrocuted. You can use a multimeter to check the voltage and current. 從這章我可以知道想要不間斷的供電可以使用ups，還有不可以打開psu 會被電死，可以使用萬用表來檢查電壓和電流', 'tags': '', 'url': '介紹.html'}, {'title': 'Power Supplies', 'text': '電源 Technicians should use surge protectors or surge suppressors to protect computers from power spikes and surges. These devices are specifically designed to absorb overvoltage conditions that would damage computers, printers, and monitors. While these devices will protect the computer from damage resulting from an overvoltage condition, they do not protect it from an undervoltage condition. Undervoltage is a condition that occurs when insufficient voltage is provided by the outlet to the computer. In situations where it is essential that the computer not lose power, technicians must install an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) to provide emergency power when a power failure (blackout) occurs or an undervoltage condition (brownout) occurs. The UPS runs the computer from its internal battery continuously and recharges the UPS’s battery while power is available. Once power is lost, the UPS continues to power the computer for up to 15 minutes (purportedly). This provides the user enough time to save work and safely power down the workstation. Another device that helps in undervoltage conditions is the standby power supply (SPS), which runs the computer directly from the wall outlet (AC power), but switches to the battery in less than a millisecond when a power outage occurs. An SPS device does not provide constant power, like a UPS device. For this reason, most technicians prefer UPS devices over SPS devices, so UPS devices are much more common in the marketplace. 技術人員應使用電湧保護器或電湧抑制器來保護計算機免受電湧和電湧的影響。這些設備經過專門設計，可以吸收可能損壞計算機，打印機和顯示器的過電壓情況。儘管這些設備可以保護計算機免受過壓狀態造成的損壞，但它們不能保護計算機免受欠壓狀態的影響。當計算機的插座提供的電壓不足時，就會發生欠壓情況。在必須確保計算機不掉電的情況下，技術人員必須安裝不間斷電源（UPS），以在發生電源故障（停電）或發生欠壓情況（斷電）時提供應急電源。 UPS會使用其內部電池連續運行計算機，並在有電時為UPS的電池充電。一旦斷電，UPS將繼續為計算機供電長達15分鐘（據稱）。這為用戶提供了足夠的時間來節省工作並安全地關閉工作站電源。備用電源（SPS）是在欠壓情況下提供幫助的另一種設備，它可以直接從壁裝電源插座（交流電源）運行計算機，但是在發生斷電時，可以在不到一毫秒的時間內切換到電池。 SPS設備不像UPS設備那樣提供恆定功率。因此，與SPS設備相比，大多數技術人員更喜歡UPS設備，因此UPS設備在市場上更為普遍。 Uninterruptible power supplies are rated in various ways, including their runtimes, network support capabilities, automatic shutdown capabilities, and surge suppression. The runtime dictates the amount of time a computer will keep running on power from the UPS’s battery once source power is removed. Usually, you want to use a UPS with at least 15 minutes of runtime support. The bigger the battery, the longer the runtime. The runtime is calculated based on volt-amps, which is discussed in more detail in a later section. UPS devices can also have software that allows them to be connected to the network. Therefore, when the UPS notices a drop in power, it can send out a message to the users that the network is being shut down because of power loss. Some UPS devices support automatic shutdown of the connected computer or server, so that once a switch to battery power occurs, the UPS sends a shutdown signal to the connected machine. Finally, most UPS devices also provide surge suppression capabilities, rated in joules. The last type of device technicians can use is called a power conditioner or line conditioner. These devices do not have any battery backup capability, but can rectify the power from a dirty power condition (where power fluctuates greatly) to a steady 115-120 VAC power condition. These devices can raise undervoltage conditions to normal levels, as well as cut overvoltage conditions back down to standard levels. This is very important if your systems are going to run from a backup generator, or if you are operating in an area with unstable power (such as in some developing countries). 重置此活動 不間斷電源的額定方式有多種，包括其運行時間，網絡支持功能，自動關機功能和電湧抑制。運行時間規定了斷開電源後計算機將繼續使用UPS電池供電的時間。通常，您要使用具有至少15分鐘運行時間支持的UPS。電池越大，運行時間越長。運行時間是基於伏安計算的，這將在後面的部分中詳細討論。 UPS設備還可以具有允許其連接到網絡的軟件。因此，當UPS注意到電源中斷時，它可以向用戶發送一條消息，通知您由於斷電而導致網絡正在關閉。某些UPS設備支持所連接的計算機或服務器的自動關機，因此一旦切換到電池電源，UPS就會向所連接的計算機發送關機信號。最後，大多數UPS設備還提供以焦耳為單位的電湧抑制功能。 技術人員可以使用的最後一種設備稱為功率調節器或線路調節器。這些設備沒有任何備用電池功能，但是可以將電源從骯髒的電源狀況（電源波動很大）整流為穩定的115-120 VAC電源狀況。這些器件可將欠壓條件提高到正常水平，並將過壓條件降低迴標準水平。如果您的系統要使用備用發電機運行，或者您在電力不穩定的區域（例如在某些發展中國家）運行，則這非常重要。 The above article told me that the difference between ups and sps includes an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages, and finally told me what to use to stabilize the voltage 上面的文章告訴我ups和sps的差別包含優缺點的分析,最後跟我說要使用什麼來穩定電壓', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Power Supplies.html'}, {'title': 'Power Variation', 'text': 'It is important to understand the technical terms for the various undervoltage and overvoltage conditions that could exist, such as power surge, dirty power, sag, brownout, and blackout, as well as the device that provides protection to the computers and computer system equipment when these conditions occur. A power surge occurs when a short increase in AC voltage happens, such as from 120 VAC to 130 VAC. To protect computers from this condition, you would use a surge suppressor. Dirty power occurs when AC voltage continuously fluctuates, for example between 113 VAC and 130 VAC. To correct this condition, an in-line UPS or line conditioner should be used. A sag occurs when an unexpected short decrease in voltage occurs. This can be corrected with either a line conditioner or a UPS. A brownout is a more significant, larger voltage drop than a sag, and could result in the voltage being cut in half (such as 120 VAC dropping to 60 VAC). This is too much for a line conditioner to handle, so a UPS would be required. Finally, if there is a complete loss of power, this is called a blackout. Only a UPS can solve this problem, but only for a short duration (purportedly about 15 minutes). If operations must continue after this, you would need to switch to a backup generator to provide the power required. 重要的是要理解可能存在的各種欠壓和過壓條件的技術術語，例如電湧，臟電源，跌落，掉電和停電，以及在以下情況下為計算機和計算機系統設備提供保護的設備：這些情況發生。當交流電壓短暫升高時（例如從120 VAC增加到130 VAC），就會發生電湧。為了保護計算機免受這種情況的影響，應使用電湧抑制器。當交流電壓持續波動時（例如，在113 VAC和130 VAC之間），會產生臟電。要糾正這種情況，應使用串聯式UPS或線路調節器。當電壓出現意外的短時下降時，就會發生下垂。可以使用電源調節器或UPS進行糾正。掉電比下垂更為顯著，更大的電壓降，並且可能導致電壓降低一半（例如120 VAC降至60 VAC）。對於線路調節器來說，這太多了，因此需要UPS。最後，如果完全斷電，則稱為停電。只有UPS可以解決此問題，但只能持續很短的時間（據說大約15分鐘）。如果此後必須繼續操作，則需要切換到備用發電機以提供所需的電源。 通過實踐學習\xa0 Match the electrical protective measure with the electrical condition it is designed to mitigate.

If a computer or outlet catches on fire, you should use a class C extinguisher, which is a carbon dioxide (CO 2 )-based extinguisher.  You should not attempt to extinguish an electrical fire with water, because water conducts electricity.  If the fire is small, you may use a portable extinguisher to put the fire out immediately, but you should never put yourself in harm’s way.  If the fire begins to get out of control, everyone should move to a safe area and call 911 for help immediately.  Some server rooms have built-in fire suppression systems that release CO 2 \xa0 or halon when a fire alarm occurs.  Halon is a toxic compressed gas, in liquid form, that chemically disrupts a combustion reaction.  A CO 2 \xa0 system is designed to flood the room with carbon dioxide in order to remove all oxygen from the room, thereby killing the fire.  People who are working in a server room and hear the fire alarm sounding must immediately vacate the area and get to a safe location.  This is a life-threatening situation, both because of the fire and because of the potentially lethal nature of the fire-suppression systems. 電力可能是引起火災的常見原因，尤其是在電路過載的情況下。如果計算機或插座著火，則應使用C類滅火器，它是一種基於二氧化碳（CO2）的滅火器。 您不應嘗試用水滅火，因為水可以導電。如果火很小，則可以使用便攜式滅火器將火立即撲滅，但絕對不要讓自己受傷。 如果火勢開始失控，所有人應移至安全區域並立即撥打119尋求幫助。一些服務器機房具有內置的滅火系統，當發生火災警報時，這些系統會釋放CO2或哈龍。 哈龍是有毒的壓縮氣體，呈液態，化學上會破壞燃燒反應。 CO2系統設計用於向房間充斥二氧化碳，以清除房間中的所有氧氣，從而撲滅大火。 在服務器機房中工作且聽到火警警報的人員必須立即離開該區域並到達安全位置。由於起火以及滅火系統的潛在致命特性，這是威脅生命的情況。 This chapter talks about using a fire extinguisher to extinguish 3c fire, and how to deal with it 這章說滅3c著火要用滅火器，和遇到時如何應對', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Protecting People and Property.html'}, {'title': 'Operational Procedures: Electrostatic Discharge', 'text': '\xa0 Another major safety hazard for computer systems and components is electrostatic discharge (ESD). ESD damage is caused by the discharge of static electricity that has been built up by the human body in the course of everyday events, such as walking, standing and sitting at our desks, and other activities. In drier (less humid) environments, static electricity builds up more quickly and becomes more of an issue. This is especially true during winter months. While static electricity cannot directly harm humans very much, it can be deadly to computer components. A person builds static electricity that can reach 20,000 to 25,000 volts, but is of a low amperage (making it safe for humans). When you touch something of lower electrical potential, such as the metal case of the computer or the circuit board of an expansion card, the static electricity in your body is discharged into that component, causing damage. If you touch a circuit board without taking ESD precautions, ESD may occur and cause permanent failure or an intermittent failure of the component. You can protect computer equipment from ESD fairly easily. First, you should use an antistatic wrist strap, also known as an ESD strap. 計算機系統和組件的另一個主要安全隱患是靜電放電（ESD）。 ESD損壞是由人體在日常活動過程中（例如走路，站立和坐在辦公桌旁以及其他活動中）積聚的靜電釋放引起的。在乾燥（濕度較低）的環境中，靜電積聚更快，成為一個更大的問題。在冬季尤其如此。儘管靜電不會直接對人類造成太大傷害，但對計算機組件而言可能是致命的。一個人產生的靜電可以達到20,000到25,000伏，但電流強度很低（對人類安全）。當您觸摸電勢較低的物體（例如計算機的金屬外殼或擴充卡的電路板）時，體內的靜電會釋放到該組件中，從而造成損壞。如果在未採取ESD預防措施的情況下觸摸電路板，則可能會發生ESD，並導致組件永久性故障或間歇性故障。 您可以相當容易地保護計算機設備免受ESD的影響。首先，應使用防靜電腕帶，也稱為ESD腕帶。 ESD strap. Photo used under CC-BY-ND license from\xa0 Carl Bereley . These devices are very inexpensive and are the best method of protecting equipment against ESD. To be effective, one end of the strap must be grounded (by clipping it to something such as to the bare metal of the computer case), and the other end is placed around your wrist like a bracelet. This continually causes a discharge from the body to the computer case, thereby protecting the internal computer components. Because of the high voltage present inside a cathode ray tube (CRT) monitor, you should not wear an ESD wrist strap when working inside a CRT monitor. If you do not have an ESD strap, you can employ the second precautionary method, called grounding against the chassis. In this method, you touch any unpainted metal part of the computer case to discharge the static electricity from your body before touching the sensitive components (such as expansion cards). This method is quite good, but you must remember to ground yourself against the case \xa0 every \xa0 time before touching a component. The last precautionary method is to use anti-static bags. This procedure is useful during transport of various components. Basically, you place the components and cards inside the anti-static bag to protect them from ESD while you are carrying them from one location to another. Anti-static bag. Photo used under CC-BY license from \xa0 Joe Hall . 這些設備非常便宜，是保護設備免受ESD影響的最佳方法。為使之有效，必須將腕帶的一端接地（通過將其修剪到諸如計算機機殼裸露的東西上），另一端像手鐲一樣放在手腕上。這連續地導致從身體向計算機機殼的放電，從而保護了計算機內部組件。由於陰極射線管（CRT）監視器內部存在高壓，因此在CRT監視器內部進行操作時，請勿佩戴ESD腕帶。 如果沒有ESD綁帶，則可以採用第二種預防方法，即與機箱接地。通過這種方法，在觸摸敏感組件（例如擴展卡）之前，請觸摸計算機機箱上任何未上漆的金屬部分，以從身上釋放靜電。這種方法非常好，但是每次觸摸組件之前，您都必須記住要使自己與外殼接觸。最後一種預防方法是使用防靜電袋。此過程在運輸各種組件時很有用。基本上，將組件和卡從一個位置運送到另一位置時，請將其放置在防靜電袋中，以防止靜電。 To prevent ESD we must ensure we handle components properly. Never touch the face of the cards where the components and wiring are located; only handle cards by the edges. Additionally, always use proper ESD straps or grounding techniques before handling the cards. You also should remove jewelry and avoid loose clothes, since they may get caught in the computer or inadvertently cause a static charge to be transferred into a component. Another great technique is the use of an anti-static mat or workbench. Many server rooms and IT shops have these mats installed, and they provide a good method of keeping yourself grounded while working. You can also raise the humidity of the room to minimize the chances of static build-up. Most computer server rooms keep humidity between 40 and 50 percent to minimize electrostatic build-up, but often you will not have control over the humidity as a technician. You also want to avoid carpeted areas when possible, as walking across carpet creates a faster buildup of static electricity in the body. Finally, never use electrical or magnetic tools on the workstation, as the electrical motors from drills, impact wrenches, and vacuums create static electricity that can be discharged into fragile components. 為了防止ESD，我們必須確保正確處理組件。切勿觸摸組件和配線所在的卡的表面；只能處理邊緣的卡。 此外，在處理插卡之前，請始終使用正確的ESD腕帶或接地技術。 您還應卸下珠寶首飾並避免穿寬鬆的衣服，因為它們可能會卡在計算機中或無意間將靜電轉移到組件中。 另一個很棒的技術是使用防靜電墊或工作台。 許多服務器機房和IT商店都安裝了這些墊子，它們是在工作時保持接地的一種好方法。 您還可以提高房間的濕度，以最大程度減少靜電積聚的機會。 大多數計算機服務器機房將濕度保持在40％到50％之間，以最大程度地減少靜電積聚，但是作為技術人員，您通常無法控制濕度。 您還希望盡可能避免舖有地毯的區域，因為在地毯上行走會在體內更快地積聚靜電。 最後，切勿在工作站上使用電動工具或電磁工具，因為鑽頭，衝擊扳手和真空吸塵器產生的電動機會產生靜電，這些靜電會排放到易碎的部件中。 From the above, you can learn how to prevent static electricity from damaging the computer 從上文可以了解到如何防止靜電對計算機造成損害', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Operational Procedures: Electrostatic Discharge.html'}, {'title': 'Operational Procedure Environmental Controls', 'text': 'So, what is the best range of environmental controls to protect our workstations and provide our computers with the best operating environment? For temperature, we seek a range of 68-76 degrees Fahrenheit, and we attempt to keep the humidity between 20 and 60 percent. If the humidity is higher, it prevents electrostatic buildup. If the humidity is too high, though, condensation and water vapor can occur. It is a fragile balance, but the best rule of thumb is that if humans are comfortable, the environment is probably within the specifications. Also, we need to ensure proper ventilation for both people and computers. We want to minimize the dust in the environment and ensure adequate cooling to remove the heat created by the workstations. Additionally, we need to consider the chemicals that we often encounter in our daily jobs. Each product that uses chemicals must have a material safety data sheet (MSDS) with it. This sheet includes the proper treatment if a person comes into contact with the substance, how to deal with chemical spills, how to properly dispose of the chemicals, and proper storage of the substance. MSDS are required for \xa0 all \xa0 products with chemicals, including things like window cleaning solution as well as more complex compounds like the thermal paste that we use in workstations. 那麼，保護我們的工作站並為我們的計算機提供最佳操作環境的最佳環境控制範圍是什麼？ 對於溫度，我們尋求的溫度範圍為華氏68-76度，並且嘗試將濕度保持在20％到60％之間。如果濕度較高，則可防止靜電積聚。 但是，如果濕度太高，則會發生冷凝和水蒸氣。 這是一個脆弱的平衡，但是最好的經驗法則是，如果人類感到舒適，則環境可能在規格範圍內。 此外，我們需要確保人和計算機的通風良好。 我們希望最大程度地減少環境中的灰塵，並確保充分冷卻以消除工作站產生的熱量。\n\n此外，我們需要考慮日常工作中經常遇到的化學物質。 每個使用化學藥品的產品都必須隨附材料安全數據表（MSDS）。 該表包括如果有人接觸該物質應採取的適當處理措施，如何處理化學溢出物，如何正確處置該化學物質以及正確存儲該物質。 所有含化學物質的產品都需要MSDS，包括窗戶清潔液以及更複雜的化合物（例如我們在工作站中使用的導熱膏）。 This chapter let me know the temperature and humidity for the computer 本章讓我知道計算機適合溫度和濕度 Since we have considered the electrical dangers a technician might face, we must also consider the physical dangers. As information technology technicians, we often are involved in the “rollout” and replacement of existing systems, and in moving equipment from one office area to another. In this portion of our jobs, we often have to move hundreds of computers. Remember, the number one cause of injury for computer technicians is lifting items that are too heavy for us. A couple of rules of thumb to prevent injury: Do not lift anything over 25 percent of your own weight without assistance. Second, remember to always lift with your legs, not your back. If you follow these two simple rules, you can avoid the most common injuries in the workplace. 由於我們已經考慮了技術人員可能面臨的電氣危險，因此我們還必須考慮物理危險。 作為信息技術人員，我們經常參與“部署”和替換現有系統，以及將設備從一個辦公區域轉移到另一個辦公區域。 在這部分工作中，我們經常不得不移動數百台計算機。 請記住，計算機技術人員受傷的首要原因是提起對我們來說太重的物品 受傷的一些經驗法則：不要在沒有幫助的情況下舉起超過自身體重25％的東西。 其次，請記住始終抬起雙腿，而不是背部。 如果遵循這兩個簡單規則，則可以避免在工作場所中最常見的傷害。 Another area of concern is our impatience. Often when we go to work on a computer, we first turn off the machine and then open it up. Many of us forget that the computer may have been on and running for the past several days or weeks, building up an enormous amount of heat that can cause burns. It is a good idea to wait at least 15 minutes before touching items at the workstation, such as a laser printer’s fuser, the central processing unit (CPU) of the computer, or the power supply of the computer. These areas tend to generate the most heat and need time to dissipate the heat prior to maintenance. 另一個值得關注的領域是我們的耐心。通常，當我們在計算機上工作時，首先關閉機器，然後再打開它。 我們中的許多人都忘記了計算機可能已經在過去的幾天或幾週內開機並運行，從而積聚了大量的熱量，可能引起灼傷。 最好等待至少15分鐘，然後再觸摸工作站上的物品，例如激光打印機的定影器，計算機的中央處理器（CPU）或計算機的電源。 這些區域往往會產生最多的熱量，並且在維護之前需要花費一定時間消散熱量。\n Finally, we must be wary of how we route cables, and must practice proper cable management. Do not run cables in the walkways or through places where employees may trip over them. If a worker trips on the cord, not only will the worker get hurt, but the workstation itself could be pulled off the desk and damaged. Place the computer and cables in a place where adequate air flow can occur; otherwise, the computer may overheat and have issues functioning. Finally, always remember to check local regulations when installing new network cables. Some areas require certain licenses or certifications, such as an electrician’s license, to run network cables. Also, you will need to install \xa0 plenum-rated cables \xa0 if you are running them in areas such as the ceiling, where ventilation systems are found. 最後，我們必須警惕如何佈設電纜，並且必須進行適當的電纜管理。 請勿在走道或員工可能絆倒的地方穿過電纜。如果工人用電線絆倒，不僅會受傷，而且工作站本身可能會從桌子上拉下來並損壞。 將計算機和電纜放置在可產生足夠空氣流通的地方；否則，計算機可能會過熱並出現問題。 最後，在安裝新的網絡電纜時，請務必記住檢查當地法規。 有些地區需要某些許可證或證明（例如電工許可證）才能運行網絡電纜。 另外，如果要在通風良好的區域（例如天花板）上鋪設增壓電纜，則需要安裝增壓電纜。 Proper cable management.

You run down to the server room to see if you can troubleshoot her connection. You look first to check if her cable is plugged in, but you find the mess of cables below. How do you determine which is your boss’ connection? This mess causes issues with ventilation, cooling, and more importantly issues when trying to troubleshoot. Always run the cabling with proper cable management techniques and label the cables to assist you in the future during troubleshooting. 那麼，為什麼電纜管理如此重要？好吧，想像一下您的老闆剛剛告訴您她的工作站失去了與網絡的連接。 您跑到服務器機房查看是否可以解決她的連接故障。您首先要檢查她的電纜是否已插入，但在下面發現電纜亂七八糟。 您如何確定老闆的聯繫方式？ 這種混亂會導致通風，冷卻問題，更重要的是，嘗試進行故障排除時會出現問題。 始終使用適當的電纜管理技術來佈線，並標記電纜，以在將來進行故障排除時為您提供幫助。 Unsafe cables.

This chapter tells me the importance of cables This chapter tells me the importance of cables Operational Procedures: CRT Disposal Many older monitors you may find in the field are CRT monitors. These older monitors look like old televisions. These monitors tend to be very heavy, with 30” or larger models weighing nearly a hundred pounds. It is important to remember your lifting rules before moving these monitors. Most people are upgrading these old monitors to LCD or LED models, since they offer better picture quality and are much lighter. Many locations have special disposal rules for these devices. Many localities have a requirement to recycle monitors at a central waste facility. Finally, these monitors use capacitors to perform their functions. You must be careful not to open these monitors, as they can have 10,000-20,000 volts of potential voltage, even when they have been unplugged for long periods of time. 您可能在現場發現的許多較舊的顯示器都是CRT顯示器。 這些較舊的監視器看起來像舊電視。這些監視器往往非常重，具有30英寸或更大的型號，重近一百磅。 在移動這些顯示器之前，請記住您的舉升規則，這一點很重要。 大多數人都將這些舊顯示器升級為LCD或LED型號，因為它們提供了更好的圖像質量並且更輕。 許多位置對於這些設備都有特殊的處置規則。 許多地方都要求在中央廢物處理設施回收監測器。最後，這些監視器使用電容器來執行其功能。 您必須小心不要打開這些顯示器，因為它們可能具有10,000-20,000伏的潛在電壓，即使長時間拔下電源也是如此。 The old screen is not only bulky and can’t be opened, even if it’s unplugged for a long time, it will be electrocuted In this module, we will discuss the various types of Internet connectivity for networks. Essentially, this connectivity provides our link to the wide area network (WAN). Each type of connection has benefits and drawbacks, so it is important that you, as a technician, understand which WAN connectivity method you should use in a given scenario. Also, we will cover the basic methods of connecting a small office/home office (SOHO) network, to include wireless devices and connection to the Internet. Networking: Internet Connectivity he oldest method of Internet connectivity is the dial-up network, usually abbreviated as DUN. Dial-up networking uses the public telephone lines using an analog audible signal over the line, which provides a maximum speed of 56 Kbps. 最早的Internet連接方法是撥號網絡，通常縮寫為DUN。 撥號網絡使用公用電話線，該公用電話線在線路上使用模擬聲音信號，最大速度為56 Kbps。 The public switched telephone network (PSTN) is made up of multiple telephone carriers from around the world. Analog connections (voice and data) using the PSTN are called plain old telephone service (POTS) connections. To connect to the Internet using POTS, you needed both a modem and a dial-up Internet service provider (ISP) to answer your dial-up call. A modem is a device that converts 1s and 0s from their digital state into an audible state that is transferred over a standard telephone line. Modem stands for modulate/demodulate, which is the process of the digital data being converted to/from analog for transmission. Modems can reside in or be connected to computers in multiple ways, including:   Add-on card (like PCI or PCIe)   Externally connected by USB and/or serial   PC card (for laptops)   Integrated in the motherboard   Mini-PCI   Mini-PCIe card (internal for laptops)   While dial-up modems were extremely popular at the dawn of the Internet in the 1980s and 1990s, the bandwidth limitation of 56 Kbps quickly become an issue as faster alternatives were sought. Eventually dial-up modems were replaced, and now they are almost nonexistent. 公共交換電話網（PSTN）由來自世界各地的多個電話運營商組成。使用PSTN的模擬連接（語音和數據）稱為普通舊電話服務（POTS）連接。要使用POTS連接到Internet，您需要調製解調器和撥號Internet服務提供商（ISP）來應答您的撥號電話。 調製解調器是一種將1和0從其數字狀態轉換為可聽狀態的設備，該狀態可通過標準電話線傳輸。調製解調器代表調製/解調，這是將數字數據轉換為模擬數據或從模擬數據轉換為傳輸數據的過程。調製解調器可以多種方式駐留在計算機中或連接到計算機，包括： 附加卡（如PCI或PCIe） 通過USB和/或串行外部連接 PC卡（用於筆記本電腦） 集成在主板上 微型PCI Mini-PCIe卡（筆記本電腦內部） 儘管撥號調製解調器在1980年代和1990年代互聯網興起之初非常受歡迎，但隨著人們尋求更快的替代方案，56 Kbps的帶寬限制迅速成為一個問題。最終，撥號調製解調器被替換了，現在它們幾乎不存在了 Integrated services digital network (ISDN) is slightly faster than basic dial-up. 集成服務數字網絡（ISDN）的速度比基本撥號略快。 \xa0ISDN was a popular alternative to DUN in the 1980s for government, corporate, and educational networks, but was too cost prohibitive for the consumer market. ISDN was one of the first “high-speed” options available to carry voice, video, or data. ISDN requires an ISDN terminal adapter, which can be internal or external and acts like a “modem” for the ISDN circuit. It takes two or more RJ-11 phone lines and binds them together to provide the desired data rate. The primary rate interface (PRI) has a maximum speed of 1.536 Mbps, but the most common ISDN service is basic rate interface, which provides either 64 Kbps (single) or 128 Kbps (double) rate service. While this is an older technology, ISDN is still entrenched in some of the larger government and educational networks because it is cost prohibitive to remove it entirely. Most entities have moved to broadband solutions such as voice over IP (VoIP) using session initiation protocol (SIP) trunks. In the next session, we will discuss the next generation of broadband data solutions. Currently, Internet protocol video teleconference (IPVT) has become more widespread and cost efficient. 對於政府，企業和教育網絡，ISDN在1980年代是DUN的一種流行替代方法，但對於消費者市場而言，成本太高了。 ISDN是最早可用於傳輸語音，視頻或數據的“高速”選項之一。 ISDN需要ISDN終端適配器，該適配器可以是內部的也可以是外部的，並且充當ISDN電路的“調製解調器”。它需要兩條或多條RJ-11電話線並將它們綁在一起以提供所需的數據速率。主速率接口（PRI）的最大速度為1.536 Mbps，但是最常見的ISDN服務是基本速率接口，它提供64 Kbps（單速率）或128 Kbps（雙速率）服務。儘管這是一種較舊的技術，但ISDN在某些較大的政府和教育網絡中仍然根深蒂固，因為完全刪除它的成本高昂。大多數實體已轉向使用會話發起協議（SIP）中繼的IP語音（VoIP）等寬帶解決方案。在下屆會議上，我們將討論下一代寬帶數據解決方案。當前，互聯網協議視頻電話會議（IPVT）已經變得更加普及和具有成本效益。 One of the first consumer replacements for dial-up service was the digital subscriber line (DSL). DSL solved the 56.6 Kbps limitation of DUN and effectively began the consumer \xa0 broadband \xa0 demand for greater Internet speeds. DSL utilizes the existing POTS network that already exists at homes and offices and allows the digital signal to piggyback on the normal analog phone line. DSL is referred to as xDSL with two main varieties: asymmetric DSL (ADSL) and symmetric DSL (SDSL). Other variants of xDSL include high-bit-rate DSL (HDSL); symmetric high-speed DSL (SHDSL), which is a form of symmetric DSL; and very-high-bit-rate DSL second-generation (VDSL2), a form of ADSL using combined fiber optics with copper to achieve greater speeds. ADSL provides high-speed Internet with a faster download speed than its upload speed. Download speeds are between 384 Kbps and 24 Mbps, but uploads are only 128 Kbps to 3.3 Mbps. It was marketed to home users and small businesses, who utilize the Internet primarily as a consumption network, downloading much more information than they upload. For example, if you go to a streaming video site and request a video, your request may only be a few hundred kilobytes. But, the video you receive back (download) is several hundred megabytes. This is the typical web surfing pattern of most users, so ADSL worked well for the majority of people. SDSL, on the other hand, matches the download and upload speeds. Since more bandwidth is dedicated to the upload side, speed is lost on the download side. Speed ranges from 384 Kbps to 2 Mbps for both upload and download. This was used heavily in commercial scenarios, where clients need higher upload speeds due to their business models. The biggest disadvantage of xDSL is that it is distance-dependent from the telephone company switching station or central office (CO) — the further from the CO, the greater the attenuation (signal loss) and thus the slower the speed. However, telephone companies (sometimes referred to as telco) are adding DSL loop extenders and combining fiber optics with xDSL to overcome this limitation. Cable, the second broadband solution for Internet connectivity, developed concurrently with DSL throughout the 1990s. Cable providers, like the telephone companies, had an immense infrastructure of wiring available as the broadband market grew. Remember that early LANs used coaxial cable prior to Ethernet, and the outgrowth to Internet connectivity using this infrastructure was natural. Cable television infrastructure contains both coaxial and fiber-optic cabling, which is called a hybrid fiber-coax (HFC) distribution network. Cable Internet provides homes and businesses with Internet service delivered over the existing coaxial cables in their area at a reasonable rate. Speeds ranging from 15/2 Mbps (download/upload speed) to 60/6 Mbps are now common with cable service, with some companies also adding fiber to their infrastructure, allowing them to achieve speeds greater than 100 Mbps downstream. Updated cable modems (DOCSIS 3.0) combined with wireless router specifications (AC3200) play an important role in achieving the package speeds Internet service providers (ISPs) advertise to their customers. Like xDSL, cable broadband has its own unique disadvantages. Specific frequency ranges are used for upstream (uploading) and downstream (downloading) data transmission, and all customers share a single hybrid fiber-coax hub, which means that bandwidth speeds fluctuate throughout the day during peak times when many neighbors are online. Fiber-optic and DSL networks do not suffer from this inconsistent data stream. Further, many companies are beginning to cap data usage and bill customers for over-usage. This can cause low speed during peak usage times, whereas true fiber and DSL networks provide a steady service capability that cable cannot. 撥號服務的第一個消費者替代產品是數字用戶線（DSL）。 DSL解決了DUN的56.6 Kbps限制，並有效地開始了消費者寬帶對更高互聯網速度的需求。 DSL利用家庭和辦公室中已經存在的現有POTS網絡，並允許數字信號搭載在普通的模擬電話線上。 DSL被稱為xDSL，具有兩個主要種類：非對稱DSL（ADSL）和對稱DSL（SDSL）。 xDSL的其他變體包括高比特率DSL（HDSL）；對稱高速DSL（SHDSL），是對稱DSL的一種形式；第二種是非常高比特率的DSL（VDSL2），它是一種結合了銅纜和光纖以達到更高速度的ADSL。 ADSL為高速Internet提供比其上載速度更快的下載速度。下載速度介於384 Kbps和24 Mbps之間，而上傳速度僅為128 Kbps至3.3 Mbps。它面向的是家庭用戶和小型企業，他們主要將互聯網用作消費網絡，下載的信息比上傳的信息多得多。例如，如果您訪問流媒體視頻站點並請求視頻，那麼您的請求可能只有幾百千字節。但是，您收到的視頻（下載）為數百兆字節。這是大多數用戶的典型網絡衝浪模式，因此ADSL對於大多數人來說效果很好。 另一方面，SDSL與下載和上傳速度匹配。由於更多的帶寬專用於上載側，因此速度在下載側上損失了。上傳和下載的速度範圍從384 Kbps到2 Mbps。這在商業場景中被大量使用，在商業場景中，客戶由於其業務模型而需要更高的上載速度。 xDSL的最大缺點是，它與電話公司的交換台或中心局（CO）之間的距離取決於–與CO的距離越遠，衰減（信號損耗）越大，因此速度越慢。但是，電話公司（有時稱為telco）正在添加DSL環路擴展器，並將光纖與xDSL結合起來以克服此限制。 電纜是第二個用於Internet連接的寬帶解決方案，在整個1990年代與DSL同時開發。像電話公司一樣，電纜提供商也隨著寬帶市場的增長而擁有龐大的佈線基礎設施。請記住，早期的LAN先於以太網使用同軸電纜，並且使用此基礎架構向Internet連接的擴展自然而然。有線電視基礎設施同時包含同軸電纜和光纖電纜，這稱為混合光纖同軸（HFC）分配網絡。 Cable Internet為家庭和企業提供合理的速率，通過其所在地區的現有同軸電纜提供Internet服務。電纜服務現在的速度範圍從15/2 Mbps（下載/上傳速度）到60/6 Mbps，一些公司還向其基礎架構中添加了光纖，從而使下行速度達到了100 Mbps以上。更新的電纜調製解調器（DOCSIS 3.0）與無線路由器規範（AC3200）的結合在實現Internet服務提供商（ISP）向其客戶做廣告的打包速度方面起著重要作用。像xDSL一樣，有線寬帶也有其獨特的缺點。特定的頻率範圍用於上行（上載）和下行（下載）數據傳輸，並且所有客戶共享一個混合光纖同軸集線器，這意味著在許多鄰居在線的高峰時段，帶寬速度全天都會波動。光纖和DSL網絡不會受到這種不一致的數據流的影響。此外，許多公司開始限制數據使用量並向客戶收取過度使用費用。這可能會在高峰使用時間內導致低速運行，而真正的光纖和DSL網絡提供了電纜無法提供的穩定服務能力。 \xa0major disadvantage all the aforementioned broadband solutions share is availability in rural and small towns where the infrastructure does not exist.\xa0 前述所有寬帶解決方案共享的主要缺點是在基礎設施不存在的農村和小城鎮中的可用性。 Therefore, a satellite WAN connection might be an option for those requiring faster Internet service but who lack the infrastructure to receive it from the telephone or cable companies. Satellite Internet can provide fast speeds like a DSL modem, but contains low bandwidth usage limits with high costs for over-the-limit usage. Satellite tends to be an expensive option in comparison to cable and DSL service, but is often the only option in remote areas. There are two potential design problems that should be considered when using satellite service: delay and weather conditions. First, the service provided by satellite has a high delay and lag time compared to more traditional Internet options. This lag time is because the signal has to travel from your satellite dish to the satellite, then to the ground station, and return through the same path. This travel time requires nearly half a second for a roundtrip to occur, because the satellite is in orbit at 22,000 miles above the earth. Second, the weather can affect your service. Just like when you watch satellite television during a thunderstorm or heavy snow, satellite Internet can be disconnected due to heavy weatherconditions. 因此，對於那些需要更快的Internet服務但又缺乏從電話或電纜公司那裡接收Internet的基礎設施的用戶來說，可以使用衛星WAN連接。衛星Internet可以像DSL調製解調器一樣提供較快的速度，但包含的帶寬使用限制較低，超出限制的使用成本較高。與電纜和DSL服務相比，衛星往往是昂貴的選擇，但通常是偏遠地區的唯一選擇。使用衛星服務時，應考慮兩個潛在的設計問題：延遲和天氣狀況。首先，與傳統互聯網選項相比，衛星提供的服務具有較高的延遲和延遲時間。該滯後時間是因為信號必須從衛星天線傳播到衛星，然後再傳播到地面站，然後通過同一路徑返回。由於衛星在離地球22,000英里的軌道上運行，因此往返所需的時間將近半秒。其次，天氣會影響您的服務。就像在雷雨或大雪期間觀看衛星電視一樣，由於惡劣的天氣，衛星互聯網可能會斷開連接。 The last broadband solution is Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX), which uses microwave towers to provide fixed wireless access connectivity similar to Wi-Fi but with a larger geographical coverage connecting directly to metropolitan area networks (MANs). Following the IEEE 802.16 standard, WiMAX operates on a different radio frequency than Wi-Fi and can be used to connect businesses to a MAN as well as individual subscribers to the Internet through an ISP. Providing up to 70 Mbps, WiMAX can provide coverage to rural areas, like satellite does, but at a lesser cost and with more reliability. Distance is another factor, because within three miles (nearly five kilometers) users can connect using a wireless WiMAX device similar to a Wi-Fi access point, but greater than that distance requires a “line of sight” antenna. The WiMAX Forum is a consortium comprised of industry leaders dedicated to ensure compatibility and interoperability within the specification. WiMAX is leveraged to serve municipalities and specialized communication structures such as the Aeronautical Mobile Airport Communications System (AeroMACS). Another option for Internet connectivity, and by far the newest for mobile Internet connectivity, is cellular networks. In order to access the cellular network, you must use a cellular modem. Cellular modems come in a variety of models, including internal (mini PCIe) cards for laptops, USB external modem sticks, and Wi-Fi devices (like cellphones or MiFi units). Cellular modems operate at speeds up to 4G (100 Mbps) wherever cellular service exists. If 4G is not available, the cellular modems are backward compatible with the older networks such as 3G at 800 Kbps and 2G at 56 Kbps speeds. Smartphones can now be turned into wireless hotspots through tethering. With tethering, the phone acts like a cellular modem for a tablet or computer. You can connect devices to the cell phone through Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or the USB port and then out to the Internet through the cellular network. The only requirement is that the smartphone has Wi-Fi capability. Due to the underlying infrastructure, 4G data speed is significantly greater than 3G. Until 2015, the infrastructure was either mobile WiMax or LTE. Mobile WiMAX was adopted by Sprint, Intel, and other industry leaders to be the next generation for cellular carriers. While some mobile carriers invested and developed access through mobile WiMAX, others backed 4G LTE, which progressed from the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) standard. Both standards, as with all cellular networking, are incredibly sensitive to distance from carrier towers. As of March 2016, Mobile WiMAX lost the backing of Sprint when they shut down their mobile WiMAX network, and it appears that LTE will be the infrastructure supporting 4G. A standard under development and expected to be released sometime in the early 2020s is 5G. The premise of this standard is that Internet connectivity has become more of a requirement than a luxury. Although the cellular market has moved away from mobile WiMAX, the infrastructure is still available throughout the world for fixed wireless. The Internet of things (IoT) is a phrase used to describe the convergence that is taking place now in the 21st century, when any and all capable devices will be connected to the Internet. From smart homes and their subsystems, to appliances, to automobiles with Wi-Fi and GPS, users will be deriving benefits from broadband technologies and “always on” connectivity. The 5G standard and other major initiatives in the fiber-optic and Wi-Fi industries are promising to move toward that end. Groups such as the WiMAX Forum and many other industry leaders are heavily investing in bringing together device connectivity under the IoT umbrella. As we previously mentioned, both cable and xDSL networks benefit by incorporating fiber into the back end (known as the \xa0 backhaul \xa0 ), which increases the overall bandwidth available to the customer. Another major benefit of fiber is its resistance to electromagnetic interference. 最新的寬帶解決方案是全球微波訪問互操作性（WiMAX），它使用微波塔提供類似於Wi-Fi的固定無線訪問連接，但是地理覆蓋範圍更大，可以直接連接到城域網（MAN）。遵循IEEE 802.16標準，WiMAX的工作頻率與Wi-Fi的無線電頻率不同，可用於將企業連接到MAN以及將單個訂戶通過ISP連接到Internet。 WiMAX可以提供高達70 Mbps的速度，可以像衛星一樣向農村地區提供覆蓋，但是成本更低，可靠性更高。距離是另一個因素，因為用戶可以在三英里（近五公里）內使用類似於Wi-Fi接入點的無線WiMAX設備進行連接，但距離超過該距離則需要“視線”天線。 WiMAX論壇是一個由行業領導者組成的聯盟，致力於確保規範內的兼容性和互操作性。 WiMAX被用於服務市政當局和專用通信結構，例如航空移動機場通信系統（AeroMACS）。 蜂窩網絡是Internet連接的另一種選擇，也是迄今為止最新的移動Internet連接。為了訪問蜂窩網絡，必須使用蜂窩調製解調器。蜂窩調製解調器有多種型號，包括用於筆記本電腦的內部（微型PCIe）卡，USB外部調製解調器棒和Wi-Fi設備（例如手機或MiFi設備）。蜂窩調製解調器在任何存在蜂窩服務的地方都可以高達4G（100 Mbps）的速度運行。如果無法使用4G，則蜂窩調製解調器將與較早的網絡向後兼容，例如800 Kbps的3G和56 Kbps的速度的2G。 現在，可以通過網絡共享將智能手機變成無線熱點。通過網絡共享，電話就像平板電腦或計算機的蜂窩調製解調器一樣。您可以通過藍牙，Wi-Fi或USB端口將設備連接到手機，然後通過蜂窩網絡連接到Internet。唯一的要求是智能手機必須具有Wi-Fi功能。 由於具有基礎架構，因此4G數據速度明顯高於3G。直到2015年，基礎設施還是移動WiMax或LTE。移動WiMAX被Sprint，英特爾和其他行業領導者採用，成為蜂窩運營商的下一代產品。一些移動運營商通過移動WiMAX投資並開發了接入服務，而其他移動運營商則支持從全球移動通信系統（GSM）標準發展而來的4G LTE。與所有蜂窩網絡一樣，這兩個標準對與運營商塔樓的距離都非常敏感。截至2016年3月，移動WiMAX在關閉其移動WiMAX網絡時失去了Sprint的支持，並且看來LTE將成為支持4G的基礎架構。 5G是正在開發中的標準，預計將在2020年代初發布。該標準的前提是，Internet連接已成為一種需求，而非奢侈。儘管蜂窩市場已經脫離了移動WiMAX，但該基礎設施仍在全球範圍內用於固定無線。物聯網（IoT）是一個短語，用於描述21世紀現在正在發生的融合，屆時，任何功能強大的設備都將連接到Internet。從智能家居及其子系統，到家用電器，再到具有Wi-Fi和GPS的汽車，用戶將從寬帶技術和“始終在線”的連接中受益。光纖和Wi-Fi行業中的5G標準和其他主要舉措有望朝著這一目標邁進。 WiMAX論壇等組織和許多其他行業領導者正在大力投資，以在IoT框架下整合設備連接性。 如前所述，電纜和xDSL網絡都受益於將光纖集成到後端（稱為回程）中，從而增加了可供客戶使用的整體帶寬。纖維的另一個主要優點是它具有抗電磁干擾的能力。 The above mentioned that at the beginning of the network, the telephone line must be connected to the optical fiber network. Finally, the development principles and benefits of wireless satellite base stations 以上說了網路的開始要接電話線到光纖網路，最後再說無線衛星基地台的發展原理和好處 The first and probably the most important step in deploying a wireless network is the planning phase. A site survey is the process of evaluating a network solution to deliver the required coverage, data rates, network capacity, roaming capacity, and quality of service. Factors that affect the number of access points needed in a building include:   The size of the building.   The number and type of walls in the building and their composition.   The type of interference or obstructions between stations and the access point.   The presence of high-voltage equipment (microwaves, power transformers, air-conditioning/heating units, elevators, etc.).   Existing wired and wireless implementations.   Bandwidth requirements.   To connect your device to the Internet, you need to have two things. First, you must have an Internet access device (or modem) such as we described in the previous section. This is really dependent on your requirements and the ISP choices where you are located. The Internet service provider (ISP) you choose will determine the type of modem you need and will supply the customer-premises equipment (CPE) for the outside of the building. Next, you must provide your network with a router, which serves as the interconnection point from your local area network clients (LAN) to the ISP external network (WAN). There are really only 11 steps to set up a small office, home office (SOHO) network:   Decide on the type of Internet connection you will use. The ISP you choose will determine the type of modem you need and whether you buy or lease it. For a small office or home office, your most obvious choices will most likely be fiber, cable, or DSL, although a satellite, WiMAX, or cellular connection might be viable.   Determine how your workstations, often referred to as clients, will connect to the router. Will you use a wireless access point or wired Ethernet switch?   Choose the modem and router that will support your first two choices.   Set up the account with the ISP. They will come to your location to set up the CPE, including any wiring to the location where you determine the modem is to be placed. Whether you chose to lease or buy your own modem, the ISP usually offers a service to set up the connection between the modem and your LAN router. You also have the option of installing it yourself.   Cable the modem and router together.   Configure the router and wireless access point (if used).   Connect each client to the network (cabled or wireless) and verify they are working properly.   Configure each device to be part of the same workgroup or create a homegroup; this will allow you to configure each client to share resources like printers and file sharing.   Set up file and print sharing on each client designating which resources to share.   Test each client to verify they can reach the Internet.   Test the resources you shared in step 9 to make sure they are connected. If everything is working, you have an effective, Internet-connected workgroup that can share resources internally, as well   部署無線網絡的第一步也是最重要的一步是規劃階段。站點調查是評估網絡解決方案以提供所需覆蓋範圍，數據速率，網絡容量，漫遊容量和服務質量的過程。\n 影響建築物所需接入點數量的因素包括：   建築物的大小。 建築物中牆壁的數量和類型及其組成。 站點與接入點之間的干擾或障礙類型。 存在高壓設備（微波爐，電源變壓器，空調/加熱裝置，電梯等）。 現有的有線和無線實現。 帶寬要求。 要將設備連接到Internet，您需要做兩件事。首先，您必須具有上一節所述的Internet訪問設備（或調製解調器）。這實際上取決於您的要求和您所在位置的ISP選擇。您選擇的Internet服務提供商（ISP）將確定所需的調製解調器的類型，並將為建築物的外部提供客戶駐地設備（CPE）。接下來，您必須為網絡提供一個路由器，該路由器用作從局域網客戶端（LAN）到ISP外部網絡（WAN）的互連點。   設置小型辦公室，家庭辦公室（SOHO）網絡實際上只有11個步驟：   確定您將使用的Internet連接類型。您選擇的ISP將確定所需的調製解調器類型以及是否購買或租賃它。對於小型辦公室或家庭辦公室，儘管衛星，WiMAX或蜂窩連接可能可行，但最明顯的選擇很可能是光纖，電纜或DSL。 確定您的工作站（通常稱為客戶端）如何連接到路由器。您將使用無線接入點還是有線以太網交換機？ 選擇將支持您的前兩個選擇的調製解調器和路由器。 使用ISP設置帳戶。他們將來到您的位置來設置CPE，包括到您確定要放置調製解調器的位置的任何佈線。無論您選擇租賃還是購買自己的調製解調器，ISP通常都會提供一項服務來建立調製解調器與LAN路由器之間的連接。您還可以選擇自己安裝它。 將調製解調器和路由器連接在一起。 配置路由器和無線訪問點（如果使用）。 將每個客戶端連接到網絡（電纜或無線），並驗證它們是否正常運行。 將每個設備配置為同一工作組的一部分或創建一個家庭組；這將允許您配置每個客戶端以共享打印機和文件共享等資源。 在每個客戶端上設置文件和打印共享，以指定要共享的資源。 測試每個客戶端以驗證他們可以訪問Internet。 測試您在步驟9中共享的資源，以確保它們已連接。如果一切正常，您將擁有一個有效的，與Internet連接的工作組，該工作組也可以在內部共享資源。 如您所見，第六步要求您配置無線路由器。觀看此視頻，以了解有關如何配置SOHO無線路由器的更多說明。     影響建築物所需接入點數量的因素包括： 建築物的大小。 建築物中牆壁的數量和類型及其組成。 站點與接入點之間的干擾或障礙類型。 存在高壓設備（微波爐，電源變壓器，空調/加熱裝置，電梯等）。 現有的有線和無線實現。 帶寬要求。 要將設備連接到Internet，您需要做兩件事。首先，您必須具有上一節所述的Internet訪問設備（或調製解調器）。這實際上取決於您的要求和您所在位置的ISP選擇。您選擇的Internet服務提供商（ISP）將確定所需的調製解調器的類型，並將為建築物的外部提供客戶駐地設備（CPE）。接下來，您必須為網絡提供一個路由器，該路由器用作從局域網客戶端（LAN）到ISP外部網絡（WAN）的互連點。 設置小型辦公室，家庭辦公室（SOHO）網絡實際上只有11個步驟： 確定您將使用的Internet連接類型。您選擇的ISP將確定所需的調製解調器類型以及是否購買或租賃它。對於小型辦公室或家庭辦公室，儘管衛星，WiMAX或蜂窩連接可能可行，但最明顯的選擇很可能是光纖，電纜或DSL。 確定您的工作站（通常稱為客戶端）如何連接到路由器。您將使用無線接入點還是有線以太網交換機？ 選擇將支持您的前兩個選擇的調製解調器和路由器。 使用ISP設置帳戶。他們將來到您的位置來設置CPE，包括到您確定要放置調製解調器的位置的任何佈線。無論您選擇租賃還是購買自己的調製解調器，ISP通常都會提供一項服務來建立調製解調器與LAN路由器之間的連接。您還可以選擇自己安裝它。 將調製解調器和路由器連接在一起。 配置路由器和無線訪問點（如果使用）。 將每個客戶端連接到網絡（電纜或無線），並驗證它們是否正常運行。 將每個設備配置為同一工作組的一部分或創建一個家庭組；這將允許您配置每個客戶端以共享打印機和文件共享等資源。 在每個客戶端上設置文件和打印共享，以指定要共享的資源。 測試每個客戶端以驗證他們可以訪問Internet。 測試您在步驟9中共享的資源，以確保它們已連接。如果一切正常，您將擁有一個有效的，與Internet連接的工作組，該工作組也可以在內部共享資源。 如您所見，第六步要求您配置無線路由器。觀看此視頻，以了解有關如何配置SOHO無線路由器的更多說明。 As you can see, step six asks you to configure a wireless router.

This temporary storage is called RAM, or random access memory. RAM is the workspace for the CPU to process data. When the computer boots up the OS (operating system) loads the start files into RAM. RAM is dynamic and constantly changing. It operates much faster than a hard drive, and can be changed at any time by the computer. RAM is volatile memory which means it loses all its information when power is removed, so it can only be used as temporary storage. This memory is used for operating systems startup files (bootstrap loader), programs, data, and disk caching. Adding RAM to a computer is one of the easiest and most effective upgrades a person can perform, since it drastically improves the transfers between the CPU and the other input devices (like hard drives), and this increases the overall speed of the computer. \n \n PCH6:Memory and BIOS \n \n \n 為了使電腦正常運行，它需要一個臨時存儲空間來存儲從用戶或硬碟輸入到電腦中的數據，並將要寫入的數據存儲到更永久的存儲裝置中。該臨時存儲區稱為RAM或隨機存取存儲器。RAM是CPU處理數據的工作區。電腦啟動系統時（操作系統）將啟動資料加載到RAM中。RAM是動態的並且不斷變化。它的運行速度比硬碟驅動器快得多，並且可由電腦隨時更改。RAM是揮發性記憶體，這意味著在斷電時它會失去所有資料，因此只能用作臨時存儲。該記憶體用於操作系統啟動文件（引導加載程序）、程序、資料和磁碟緩存。在電腦裡增加RAM是一個最簡單，最有效的升級之一，因為它可以極大地改善CPU與其他輸入設備（如硬碟）之間的傳輸，從而提高了電腦運行的整體速度。 \n One of the uses of memory is to serve as a disk cache. Like the caches we mentioned in the processor, the RAM acts as a faster, temporary storage area for recently used and commonly used data from the hard drive. Because it is quicker to access RAM than to seek out the data in the hard drive’s sectors, RAM increases the performance of the machine. Disk caching can be used only when there is available extra space in the memory. But what happens if you do not have enough physical memory available? When there is not enough physical memory, the computer creates virtual memory. Virtual memory is sometimes referred to as "page files" or “swap files.” Virtual memory is a slow substitute for RAM since it is a temporary file created on the hard drive and emulates the physical RAM. Essentially, disk caching allows RAM to act like an extremely fast hard drive, while virtual memory consists of files on the hard drive acting as extremely slow memory. RAM is faster than either magnetic storage (like hard drives and floppy disks) or optical storage (DVD, CD, Blu-ray). This is because RAM is a solid-state device without exceedingly long access times. RAM operates in the billionths of a second (nanoseconds), while hard drives and other magnetic media are very slow, operating in the thousandths of a second (milliseconds). Insufficient RAM causes a computer to operate more slowly. So, upgrading RAM is one of the most common upgrades performed by an A+ technician. \n \n 記憶體的用途之一是充當磁碟緩存。就像我們在處理器中提到的緩存一樣，RAM為硬碟中最近使用和常用的資料提供了更快的臨時存儲區。由於讀取RAM比查找磁碟區中的數據更快，因此RAM可提高電腦的性能。僅有在記憶體中有可用空間時才可以使用磁碟緩存。但是，如果您沒有足夠的物理內存可用怎麼辦？當物理內存不足時，電腦將創建虛擬記憶體。虛擬記憶體有時也稱為“分頁檔”或“交換空間”。虛擬記憶體是RAM的慢速替代品，因為它是在硬碟上創建的臨時空間，並模擬物理記憶體。本質上，磁碟緩存使RAM可以充當極快的硬碟，而虛擬記憶體由硬碟上的組成，它們的運行速度非常慢。 RAM的速度比其他磁存儲（如硬碟和軟碟）或光存儲（DVD，CD，藍光）要快。這是因為RAM是固態設備，讀取時間很短。 RAM的運行速度為十億分之一秒，而硬碟和其他磁性介質的運行速度非常慢，其運行速度為千分之一秒（毫秒）。 RAM不足會導致電腦運行變慢。因此，升級RAM是A +技術人員執行的最常見的升級之一。 \n Classifying Memory \n There are multiple classifications for RAM: memory module type, chip type, speed, and parity. Memory modules vary by type, which is defined by the motherboard and the motherboard’s form factor. Memory modules are defined by the number of pins they have on the modules, like 240-pin DIMM (dual in-line memory module), 184-pin DIMM, etc. \n RAM is also classified based upon memory chip type. In the past, systems used different types of chips based on their manufacturer, but current systems use mostly the same type, usually DDR (dual data rate), DDR2, or DDR3. Although the DDR is the most common type, some unique systems may use RDRAM (Rambus dynamic random access memory). \n Another RAM classification is based on speed. Older memory was classified in nanoseconds (for example, 60 nanoseconds). Over time, all memory became nearly the same speed, as measured in nanoseconds, so they changed this to bus speed (for example, PC-133 memory operates at a bus speed of 133 MHz). Most contemporary memory is now measured in throughput (PC2-6400, which operates at 800 MHz but has 6.4 GBps of bandwidth). \n Finally, memory can be purchased with and classified by parity, non-parity, or ECC. Parity memory checks for errors as data is read/written to the chip. While parity memory can detect an error, it cannot correct it. Non-parity memory, one of the most common types found in desktop computers, has no error checking ability. Error correcting code (ECC) is an advanced version of parity that can find an error and correct that error as it is read/written from the chip. Due to these additional functions, ECC tends to be slower than equivalent non-parity RAM. \n \n \n 記憶分類 \n RAM 有多種分類 : 記憶體模組類型、芯片類型、速度和奇偶校驗。記憶體模組因類型而異，具體取決於主機板的外形尺寸。記憶體模塊由其上的針腳數量定義，例如 240 針 DIMM （雙列直插式記憶體模組）， 184 針 DIMM 等。 \n RAM 也根據存儲芯片類型進行分類。過去，系統根據製造商使用不同類型的芯片，但是當前的系統大多使用相同類型的芯片，通常是 DDR （雙數據速率）， DDR2 或 DDR3 。儘管 DDR 是最常見的類型，但某些獨特的系統可能會使用 RDRAM （ Rambus 動態隨機存取存儲器）。 \n 另一個 RAM 分類基於速度。較舊的內存以奈秒（例如 60 奈秒）分類。隨著時間的流逝，所有內存的速度幾乎相同，以奈秒為單位，因此他們將其更改為總線速度（例如， PC-133 內存以 133 MHz 的總線速度運行）。現在，大多數當代內存都是按吞吐量衡量的（ PC2-6400 ，工作於 800 MHz ，但具有 6.4 GBps 的帶寬）。 \n 最後，可以使用奇偶校驗，非奇偶校驗或 ECC 購買存儲器並按其分類。奇偶校驗存儲器在將數據讀 / 寫到芯片時檢查錯誤。儘管奇偶校驗內存可以檢測到錯誤，但無法糾正錯誤。非奇偶校驗內存是台式計算機中最常見的類型之一，沒有檢查錯誤的功能。除錯碼（ ECC ）是奇偶校驗的高級版本，可以發現錯誤並在從芯片讀取 / 寫入該錯誤時對其進行糾正。由於這些附加功能， ECC 往往比等效的非奇偶校驗 RAM 慢。 \n Determining Type of Memory Based on Motherboard \n The type of memory that you need to use is determined by the motherboard. The best practice is to check the motherboard’s manual for the proper type, size, and speed of memory before purchasing new modules. Some motherboards will allow you to mix the sizes of the modules, while others require all modules to be the same size. For example, if there are two memory slots on a motherboard, it may allow you to put a 1 GB module in one slot, and a 2 GB module in another. Other motherboards require all slots to have the same size chips in them, such as 1 GB modules in both slots. Another factor to consider is the “bank” size of the motherboard. Some motherboards support a bank of one, meaning you can use a single module in the motherboard. Other motherboards require two modules to complete a bank (the slots must be filled in pairs). \n Another feature that your motherboard may support is called dual-channel or triple-channel. In these channel modes, the motherboard requires that the user install identical size and speed modules in two (dual) or three (triple) slots. This allows for the interleaving of memory access for faster performance times of the memory, speeding up the computer’s operations. Think about interleaving as if you had two horses pulling a cart instead of one. While each horse may be able to pull 100 pounds on its own, together they can pull 250 pounds. Interleaving in the context of memory is the same idea—speed of access increases when memory is interleaved. The sum total of both memory chips can be accessed faster together than either could individually. \n Finally, the total number of modules that can be installed is also determined by the motherboard’s form factor. If you have a smaller form factor motherboard, such as mini-ATX, it may have fewer slots for modules (maybe two slots versus four or six on a full ATX board). \n \xa0 \n 基於主機板確定內存類型 \n 您需要使用的內存類型由主機板決定。最佳做法是在購買新模組之前，先檢查主機板手冊中的內存類型，大小和速度是否正確。某些主機板可讓您混合使用模組的大小，而另一些則要求所有模組的大小均相同。例如，如果主機板上有兩個記憶體插槽，則可能允許您在一個插槽中放置一個1 GB的模組，在另一個插槽中放置一個2 GB的模組。其他主機板要求所有插槽中都具有相同大小的芯片，例如兩個插槽中都有1 GB的模組。要考慮的另一個因素是主機板的“庫”大小。一些主機板支持一組，這意味著您可以在主機板中使用單個模組。其他主機板需要兩個模組來完成存儲（插槽必須成對填充）。 \n 主機板可能支持的另一個功能稱為雙通道或三通道。在這些通道模式下，主機板要求用戶在兩個（雙）或三個（三重）插槽中安裝相同尺寸和速度的模組。這樣可以交錯訪問內存，以加快內存的性能，從而加快計算機的運行速度。思考一下，就好像您有兩匹馬拉著一輛馬車。雖然每匹馬可以自己可以拉100磅，但它們合起來可以拉250磅。在內存在運行中進行交錯是相同的想法—交錯記憶體時讀取速度會提高。一起讀取兩個記憶體芯片的總和比單獨讀取一個芯片更快。 \n 最後，可安裝的模組總數也由主機板的外形尺寸決定。如果您使用的是較小型的主機板，例如mini-ATX，則其模組插槽可能會更少（也許是兩個插槽，而完整的ATX板上則是四個或六個）。 \n \n Different types of RAM have been in common use during different time periods. It is important to understand them all, because many companies use a mix of legacy systems and more current ones. DRAM, or dynamic RAM, is one of the oldest types. It requires frequent refreshing of contents. DRAM stores each bit of data or program code in a storage cell consisting of a capacitor and a transistor, and is typically organized in a rectangular configuration of storage cells. A DRAM storage cell is dynamic in that it needs to be refreshed or given a new electronic charge every few milliseconds to compensate for charge leaks from the capacitor. \n SRAM, or static RAM, solved the issue of the need for constant refreshing, but it is quite expensive to manufacture. Therefore, SRAM is only used for very high-speed needs, such as level 1, level 2, and level 3 CPU caches, hard drive buffers, and LCD screen buffers. \n SDRAM, or synchronous DRAM, was the first memory that operated at the same speed as the motherboard’s bus. The initial chips were 168-pin dual in-line memory modules, which have their speed rated in MHz. Common naming conventions include PC-66 (which is equivalent to 66 Mhz), or PC-133, or PC-266. \n While SDRAM performs at the same speed as the motherboard’s bus, the CPU operates many times faster than the motherboard’s bus. DDR SDRAM stands for double data rate synchronous dynamic random access memory. This type of memory can transfer data two times per clock cycle, thereby doubling the speed over traditional SDRAM. These chips come in 184-pin varieties, rated in MBps (throughput). A good example of this is something like PC-1600, which is 1600 MBps throughput. \n DDR2 SDRAM is double double data rate SDRAM, which has a higher\xa0 latency \xa0but faster access to the external bus. These chips have 240 pins to connect their modules to the slot, and are also rated in MBps, such as PC2-4200, which is 4200 MBps (or 4.2 GBps). \n DDR3 SDRAM is known as double data rate 3 SDRAM, and is the latest generation of SDRAM in use today. It runs at a lower voltage and is faster than DDR2, but again the latency is increased over the previous DDR2 modules. These modules also have 240 pins, but they are “keyed” differently than DDR2. The “keyed” portion is where the gap in the pins is located, so only a DDR2 will fit in a DDR2 slot, and a DDR3 will fit only in a DDR3 slot. The common notation for these is PC3-10600, where the 10600 is the speed in MBps. \n Rambus direct ram (RDRAM) is also known as RIMM (Rambus in-line memory module). These modules come in a 184-pin variant (16-bit version) and a 232-pin variant (32-bit version). Each empty slot in the motherboard has to have a continuity module (CRIMM) placed inside it, or the motherboard won’t recognize the memory properly. This is not used in recent systems, but was used heavily in Pentium 4 systems. The RDRAM is measured in MBps, such as RIMM 4200 (or 4200 MBps). \n \n \n 在不同時間裡，使用的RAM是不同類型。了解所有這些信息非常重要，因為許多公司是舊系統和最新系統混合使用。 DRAM或動態RAM是最古老的類型之一。它需要經常刷新內容。 DRAM將數據或程序代碼的每一位存儲在由電容器和晶體管組成的存儲單元中，並且通常以矩形配置的存儲單元來組織。 DRAM處存單元是動態的，因為它需要每幾毫秒刷新一次或給其提供新的電荷，以補償電容器的電荷洩漏。 \n SRAM或靜態RAM解決了持續刷新的問題，但製造成本很高。因此，SRAM僅用於非常高速的需求，例如1級，2級和3級CPU高速緩存，硬碟緩衝區和LCD螢幕緩衝區。 \n SDRAM或同步DRAM是第一個以與主板總線相同的速度運行的內存。最初的芯片是168針雙列直插式內存模組，其速度額定為MHz。常見的命名約定包括PC-66（相當於66 Mhz），PC-133或PC-266。 \n 儘管SDRAM的性能與主板總線相同，但CPU的運行速度比主板總線快許多倍。 DDR SDRAM代表雙倍數據速率同步動態隨機存取存儲器。這種類型的存儲器可以在每個時段週期兩次傳輸數據，從而使速度比傳統SDRAM快一倍。這些芯片有184引腳的型號，額定為MBps（吞吐量）。一個很好的例子就是PC-1600，吞吐量為1600 MBps。 \n DDR2 SDRAM是雙倍數據速率SDRAM，具有更高的延遲，但對外部總線的讀取速度更快。這些芯片具有240個針腳以將其模組連接到插槽，並且還以MBps額定，例如PC2-4200，即4200 MBps（或4.2 GBps）。 \n DDR3 SDRAM被稱為雙倍資料傳輸率3 SDRAM，是當今使用的最新一代SDRAM。它在較低的電壓下運行，並且比DDR2更快，但是與之前的DDR2模組相比，延遲又增加了。這些模組也具有240個針腳，但是它們的“鍵控”與DDR2不同。 “鍵控”部分是針腳之間的間隙所在的位置，因此只有DDR2可以插入DDR2插槽，而DDR3只能插入DDR3插槽。這些的常用符號是PC3-10600，其中10600是MBps的速度。 \n Rambus RAM（RDRAM）也被稱為RIMM（Rambus嵌入式存儲模組）。這些模組具有184針變種（16位版本）和232針變種（32位版本）。主板上的每個空插槽都必須在其中放置一個連續性模組（CRIMM），否則主板將無法正確識別內存。在最近的系統中未使用此功能，但在Pentium 4系統中大量使用了此功能。 RDRAM以MBps為單位進行度量，例如RIMM 4200（或4200 MBps）。 \n \n There are other variants of memory that have been used over the years, but they are not common today. The single inline memory module, or SIMM, has either 30 or 72 connectors on both sides of the chip. The single inline pin package, or SIPP, has only 30 pins, and they are physical pins instead of connectors. \n Dual inline memory module, or DIMM, is what is used for DDR, DDR2, and DDR3 chips, with each side of the module having different pinouts in the connectors. The SODIMM, small outline DIMM, is a compact version of memory used in laptops, notebooks, and printers. It can come in DDR SODIMM, DDR2 SODIMM, or DDR3 SODIMM. SODIMM is very common and still heavily used today. \n Finally, there is a laptop version of Rambus memory called small outline Rambus module, but it is rarely used in contemporary systems. \n \n \n 多年以來，內存還使用了其他變體，但今天並不常見。 單列直插式內存模組或SIMM在芯片的兩側都有30或72個連接器。 單列直插式引腳封裝或SIPP只有30個針腳，它們是物理針腳而不是連接器。 \n DDR，DDR2和DDR3芯片使用雙列直插式內存模組或DIMM，模塊的每一側在連接器中具有不同的針腳排列。 SODIMM是小型DIMM，是便攜式電腦，筆記本電腦和打印機中使用的緊湊型記憶體。 它可以採用DDR SODIMM，DDR2 SODIMM或DDR3 SODIMM。 SODIMM非常普遍，今天仍然大量使用。 \n 最後，有一個筆記本電腦版本的Rambus存儲器，稱為小型Rambus模組，但在現代系統中很少使用 \n Memory Module Width \n Memory module width is measured by the number of bits that can be transferred. Memory began in 8-bit varieties, but has increased to 16 bits, 32 bits, and now 64 bits in current systems. Memory must be added in banks to ensure the width equals the width of the memory bus. For example, if you need 64 bits and a single module offers 64 bits, then it will have one module in the bank. Dual-channel memory requires double the amount, therefore two 64-bit (128 bit) DIMMs are needed in the banks, while three are required for triple-channel, as was mentioned earlier. \n \n 記憶體模組寬度 \n 記憶體模組的寬度由可傳輸的位數決定。 內存最初以8位形式出現，但在當前系統中已增加到16位，32位和現在的64位。 必須以存儲體的形式添加內存，以確保其寬度等於記憶體總線的寬度。 例如，如果您需要64位，而單個模組提供64位，則庫中將只有一個模組。 如前所述，雙通道內存需要兩倍的存儲量，因此存儲庫中需要兩個64位（128位）DIMM，而三通道則需要三個。 \n Parity and ECC \n Parity is used to perform basic error checking and to ensure the memory contents are reliable. This memory is slower than non-parity, but adds the reliability needed for servers and certain desktop workstations. \n Parity checking is a rather simple method of detecting memory errors, without any correction capabilities. Parity is signified in a single bit of data that is added to the transmitted data string. If the module normally would have seven bits of data, an eighth is added as the parity bit. If the module normally would have eight chips for data, a ninth chip is added for parity. \n Every byte has a parity bit associated with it. In the case that seven bits make up the original data, there are eight total bits transmitted (seven original data bits plus one parity bit). In the case that eight bits make up the original data, a total of nine bits are transmitted (eight data bits plus one parity bit). The parity bit is set at write time, and then calculated and compared at read time to determine if any of the bits have changed since the data was stored. This type of checking is limited to detection of single bit errors. If two bits have been altered, the parity check will “pass,” and the error is allowed to possibly corrupt the data. \n Parity checking can be implemented either as “0” parity or “1” parity. When the byte is stored, the number of zeros (or ones, if “1” parity is selected) is added up. The result is stored in the parity bit – “1” if odd, “0” if even. When that byte is read from memory, the bits are again counted and the result is compared against what was stored in the parity bit. A match means that the data was not changed from when it was stored (or that two bits were altered in such a way that the result is the same). \n The process to determine the parity bit is the same, regardless of the number of original data bits transmitted. Typically, there are either seven or eight bits of original data. \n The parity bit is determined by counting the number of “1” bits in a data string. \n \n \n \n \n \n Set parity bit to: \n \n \n \n \n \n Even parity \n \n \n Odd parity \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Even number of “1” bits \n \n \n 0 \n \n \n 1 \n \n \n \n \n Odd number of “1” bits \n \n \n 1 \n \n \n 0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Set parity bit to: \n \n \n \n \n \n Even parity \n \n \n Odd parity \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Even number of “1” bits \n \n \n 0 \n \n \n 1 \n \n \n \n \n Odd number of “1” bits \n \n \n 1 \n \n \n 0 \n \n \n \n \n Set parity bit to: \n Even parity \n Odd parity \n Even number of “1” bits \n 0 \n 1 \n Odd number of “1” bits \n 1 \n 0 \n Set parity bit to: \n Even parity \n Odd parity \n Even number of “1” bits \n 0 \n 1 \n Odd number of “1” bits \n 1 \n 0 \n Set parity bit to: \n Even parity \n Odd parity \n Even number of “1” bits \n 0 \n 1 \n Odd number of “1” bits \n 1 \n 0 \n EXAMPLE \n Eight bits of original data, 11110000, are transmitted using even parity. To determine the parity bit (the ninth bit of data), count the number of “1” bits in the data string. In this case, there are four “1” bits. Because the total number of “1” bits is four, the data is even. Therefore, the parity bit is set to 0. \n \n 奇偶校驗和ECC \n 奇偶校驗用於執行基本的錯誤檢查並確保記憶體內容可靠。此記憶體比非奇偶校驗慢，但增加了伺服器和某些桌上型電腦工作站所需的可靠性。 \n 奇偶校驗是一種檢測記憶體錯誤相當簡單的方法，沒有任何校正功能。奇偶校驗在添加到傳輸數據字符串的單個數據位中表示。如果模組通常具有七個數據位，則將八分之一添加為奇偶校驗位。如果模組通常有八個芯片用於數據，則添加第九個芯片以實現奇偶校驗。 \n 每個字節都有一個與之關聯的奇偶校驗位。在七位組成原始數據的情況下，總共傳輸了八位（七位原始數據位加一個奇偶校驗位）。在八位組成原始數據的情況下，總共傳輸九位（八位數據位加一位奇偶校驗位）。奇偶校驗位在寫入時設置，然後在讀取時進行計算和比較，以確定自存儲資料以來是否有任何位發生了更改。這種類型的檢查僅限於檢測單個位錯誤。如果更改了兩位，則將“通過”奇偶校驗，並且允許該錯誤可能損壞資料。 \n 奇偶校驗可以實現為“ 0”奇偶校驗或“ 1”奇偶校驗。存儲字節時，將加零（如果選擇了“ 1”奇偶校驗，則為零）的數目。結果存儲在奇偶校驗位中-如果為奇數，則為“ 1”；如果為偶數，則為“ 0”。從記憶體中讀取該字節後，將再次對這些位進行計數，並將結果與奇偶校驗位中存儲的結果進行比較。匹配表示資料從存儲時起就沒有改變（或以結果相同的方式更改了兩位）。 \n 不管發送的原始數據位數是多少，確定奇偶校驗位的過程都是相同的。通常，原始資料有七位或八位。 \n 奇偶校驗位是通過對數據字符串中“ 1”位的數量進行計數來確定的。 \n 範例 \n 使用偶校驗發送八位原始數據11110000。 要確定奇偶校驗位（數據的第9位），請計算數據字符串中“ 1”位的數量。 在這種情況下，有四個“ 1”位。 因為“ 1”位的總數是四，所以數據是偶數。 因此，奇偶校驗位設置為0。 \n \n EXAMPLE \n Seven bits of original data, 1000010, are transmitted using odd parity. To determine the parity bit (the eighth bit of data), count the number of “1” bits in the data string. In this case, there are two “1” bits. Therefore the parity bit is set to 1, because the total number of “1” bits (two) in the data is even, which does not match the odd parity of the transmission. Because of the mismatch in the number of “1” bits and the parity setting (odd), the parity bit must be set to 1. Because the total number of “1” bits is two, adding a parity bit of “1” to the string will result in an odd number of “1” bits (three) in the full eight-bit string (seven data bits plus one parity bit). \n \n 範例 \n 使用奇偶校驗傳輸七位原始數據1000010。 要確定奇偶校驗位（數據的第八位），請計算數據字符串中“ 1”位的數量。 在這種情況下，有兩個“ 1”位。 因此，將奇偶校驗位設置為1，因為數據中“ 1”位（兩個）的總數為偶數，這與傳輸的奇數奇偶校驗不匹配。 由於“ 1”位的數量和奇偶校驗設置（奇數）不匹配，因此必須將奇偶校驗位設置為1。由於“ 1”位的總數為2，因此將奇偶校驗位“ 1”添加到 該字符串將在整個八位字符串（七個數據位加一個奇偶校驗位）中產生奇數個“ 1”位（三個）。 \n \n Since about 90 percent of all\xa0 soft errors\xa0 are of the single bit kind, parity checking is usually quite sufficient for most situations. Unfortunately, there is a penalty to be paid for error checking, which is slightly slower performance, since there are extra clock cycles spent in calculating, storing, and fetching the parity bit. One other consideration is that since the error cannot be fixed by parity, the application must actually be stopped and an error message issued indicating that a parity error was encountered. \n \n \n

parity. \n Error Correcting Code (ECC), takes the parity concept a step further by not only identifying the error, but also correcting the issue. To determine if the data has been corrected or changed from the original data as a result of parity, examine the full transmitted data string, including the parity bit. \n EXAMPLE \n 111100000 is transmitted using even parity. To determine if the memory has been changed across the transmission, count the number of “1” bits in the data string, including the parity bit. In this case, there are four “1” bits. Because the total number of “1” bits (four) in the data is even, which matches the even parity of the transmission, no memory has been changed. \n \xa0 \n \n 由於所有軟體錯誤中約有90％是單位原類型的，因此奇偶校驗通常在大多數情況下就足夠了。 不幸的是，由於要花費額外的時間週期來計算、存儲和讀取奇偶校驗位，因此錯誤檢查要付出一定的代價，這會稍微降低性能。 另一個考慮因素是，由於無法通過奇偶校驗解決錯誤，因此實際上必須停止應用程序，並發出一條錯誤消息，指出遇到奇偶校驗錯誤。 \n \n \n \n \n 原始資料 \n \n \n “ 1 ”位的計數 \n \n \n 傳輸的位元（8 位或9 位，取決於原始位元的數量），包括奇偶校驗 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 偶校驗 \n \n \n 奇校驗 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 0000000 \n \n \n 0 \n \n \n 0000000 0 \n \n \n 0000000 1 \n \n \n \n \n 0101101 \n \n \n 4 \n \n \n 0101101 0 \n \n \n 0101101 1 \n \n \n \n \n 0101010 \n \n \n 3 \n \n \n 0101010 1 \n \n \n 0101010 0 \n \n \n \n \n 10000000 \n \n \n 1 \n \n \n 1000000 1 \n \n \n 10000000 0 \n \n \n \n \n 11111100 \n \n \n 6 \n \n \n 11111100 0 \n \n \n 11111100 1 \n \n \n \n \n 10001100 \n \n \n 3 \n \n \n 10001100 1 \n \n \n 10001100 0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 原始資料 \n \n \n “ 1 ”位的計數 \n \n \n 傳輸的位元（8 位或9 位，取決於原始位元的數量），包括奇偶校驗 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 偶校驗 \n \n \n 奇校驗 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 0000000 \n \n \n 0 \n \n \n 0000000 0 \n \n \n 0000000 1 \n \n \n \n \n 0101101 \n \n \n 4 \n \n \n 0101101 0 \n \n \n 0101101 1 \n \n \n \n \n 0101010 \n \n \n 3 \n \n \n 0101010 1 \n \n \n 0101010 0 \n \n \n \n \n 10000000 \n \n \n 1 \n \n \n 1000000 1 \n \n \n 10000000 0 \n \n \n \n \n 11111100 \n \n \n 6 \n \n \n 11111100 0 \n \n \n 11111100 1 \n \n \n \n \n 10001100 \n \n \n 3 \n \n \n 10001100 1 \n \n \n 10001100 0 \n \n \n \n \n 原始資料 \n “ 1 ”位的計數 \n 傳輸的位元（8 位或9 位，取決於原始位元的數量），包括奇偶校驗 \n 偶校驗 \n 奇校驗 \n 0000000 \n 0 \n 0000000 0 \n 0000000 1 \n 0101101 \n 4 \n 0101101 0 \n 0101101 1 \n 0101010 \n 3 \n 0101010 1 \n 0101010 0 \n 10000000 \n 1 \n 1000000 1 \n 10000000 0 \n 11111100 \n 6 \n 11111100 0 \n 11111100 1 \n 10001100 \n 3 \n 10001100 1 \n 10001100 0 \n 原始資料 \n “ 1 ”位的計數 \n 傳輸的位元（8 位或9 位，取決於原始位元的數量），包括奇偶校驗 \n 偶校驗 \n 奇校驗 \n 0000000 \n 0 \n 0000000 0 \n 0000000 1 \n 0101101 \n 4 \n 0101101 0 \n 0101101 1 \n 0101010 \n 3 \n 0101010 1 \n 0101010 0 \n 10000000 \n 1 \n 1000000 1 \n 10000000 0 \n 11111100 \n 6 \n 11111100 0 \n 11111100 1 \n 10001100 \n 3 \n 10001100 1 \n 10001100 0 \n 原始資料 \n “ 1 ”位的計數 \n 傳輸的位元（8 位或9 位，取決於原始位元的數量），包括奇偶校驗 \n 偶校驗 \n 奇校驗 \n 0000000 \n 0 \n 0000000 0 \n 0000000 1 \n 0101101 \n 4 \n 0101101 0 \n 0101101 1 \n 0101010 \n 3 \n 0101010 1 \n 0101010 0 \n 10000000 \n 1 \n 1000000 1 \n 10000000 0 \n 11111100 \n 6 \n 11111100 0 \n 11111100 1 \n 10001100 \n 3 \n 10001100 1 \n 10001100 0 \n 偵錯碼（ECC）使奇偶校驗概念更進一步，不僅可以識別錯誤，還可以糾正問題。 要確定是否由於奇偶校驗而對原始數據進行了校正或更改，請檢查完整的傳輸資料字符串，包括奇偶校驗位。 \n 範例 \n 使用偶校驗發送111100000。 要確定在傳輸過程中記憶體是否已被更改，請計算數據字符串中包括奇偶校驗位的“ 1”位數。 在這種情況下，有四個“ 1”位。 由於數據中的“ 1”位（四位）總數為偶數，與傳輸的偶數奇偶校驗相匹配，因此無任何記憶體被更改。 \n \n EXAMPLE \n 10000100 is transmitted using odd parity.

The benefit of double-sided modules is that a higher amount of storage can fit on a single chip and into a single slot. Some motherboards support double-sided SIMMs, but others do not, so it is important to check the motherboard’s manual for guidance. To determine if the module is double-sided, simply look at both sides. If chips are soldered on both sides, it is a double-sided SIMM. \n Memory can be single-sided or double-sided.

Memory modules are installed as “sticks” (or modules) of memory into the “slots” on the motherboard. \n \n \n 安裝記憶體模組 \n 安裝記憶體是電腦的常見升級，並且是很容易執行的。 記憶體模組作為記憶體的“棒”（或模組）安裝在主板上的“插槽”中。 \n \n The process of installing memory sticks is fairly easy, but caution and precision are necessary. To install memory sticks (or modules): \n \n Always ensure you take proper ESD (electrostatic discharge) protection measures to ensure both the motherboard and memory modules are not harmed during installation. \n Turn off the computer and unplug the power cord. \n Open the case and begin the installation of the memory sticks. Always hold the memory sticks by the sides of the chips and never by the gold contacts. \n Line up the memory module’s connector with the slot on the motherboard. \n Verify that the locking tabs are in the open position. \n Push the module straight down until the tabs swivel to the locking position (this takes force). \n \n \n Always ensure you take proper ESD (electrostatic discharge) protection measures to ensure both the motherboard and memory modules are not harmed during installation. \n Turn off the computer and unplug the power cord. \n Open the case and begin the installation of the memory sticks.

The BIOS also manages data flow between the computer\'s operating system and attached/connected devices, such as the hard drive, video adapter, keyboard, mouse, and printer. \n \n BIOS，CMOS和韌體簡介 \n 開啟電腦後，電腦的微處理器會使用稱為BIOS（基本輸入/輸出系統）的程序來啟動電腦系統。 BIOS還管理電腦操作系統和已連接/已連接的設備（例如硬碟、影像連接器、鍵盤、滑鼠和打印機）之間的資訊流。 \n \n A computer’s BIOS is the most common example of\xa0 firmware . Firmware is software on a chip, and is the first software run by the computer when the machine is booted up. The BIOS has several roles, including performing the power-on self-test, which tests and initializes the processor, video card, disk drives, and adapters. The BIOS also includes the low-level “operating system” for the computer, which allows the computer to take input from and give output to the most basic components, including the keyboard, mouse, and disk drives. The BIOS is stored in a ROM (Read-only memory) chip, but can be upgraded through a process call “flashing.” \n While the BIOS is a program that allows the user to make changes to the settings, the settings themselves are stored in the complementary metal-oxide semiconductor, or\xa0 CMOS . The CMOS is a battery-powered memory chip. \n \n 電腦的BIOS是最常見的韌體示例。 韌體是芯片上的軟體，是韌體啟動時電腦運行的第一個軟體。 BIOS具有多個角色，包括執行開機自檢，該自檢將測試並初始化處理器，顯示卡，磁碟驅動器和連接器。 BIOS還包括用於電腦的基本“操作系統”，它使電腦可以從最基本的組件（包括鍵盤，滑鼠和磁碟驅動器）獲取輸入並提供輸出。 BIOS存儲在ROM（唯讀記憶體）芯片中，但可以通過過程調用“刷新”進行升級。 \n BIOS是允許用戶更改設置的程序，而設置本身則存儲在互補金屬氧化物半導體或CMOS中。 CMOS是電池供電的存儲芯片。 \n Understanding BIOS and CMOS \n The BIOS is used to configure common settings, such as the order in which devices are read by the computer. This order is known as the boot order. In addition, the BIOS is also used in the configuration of settings that turn on and off various input/output ports, and the configuration of various CPU settings such as virtualization \xa0and\xa0 overclocking \xa0. \n Be very careful when making changes to the BIOS. Incorrect settings may keep your computer from booting. \n \n \n 了解BIOS和CMOS \n BIOS用於配置通用設定，例如電腦讀取設備的順序。 此命令稱為引導命令。 此外，BIOS還用於配置打開和關閉各種輸入/輸出端口的設定，以及各種CPU設置（例如虛擬化和超頻）的配定。 \n 更改BIOS時要非常小心。 不正確的設置可能會使您的電腦無法啟動。 \n \n BIOS configures the following settings: \n \n Boot order \n Storage devices (USB drives, hard drives, floppy drives, optical drives) \n Built-in ports (SATA, eSATA, PATA, USB, IEEE-1394, serial, parallel, PS/2) \n AGP, PCI, PCIe slots \n Integrated chipsets (audio, video, network) \n Virtualization \n Clock speed \n Memory (RAM) \n Power management \n Intrusion detection \n Passwords and encryption \n PC health tools (temperature, voltage, etc.) \n Direct access to the web or other services without booting computer (UEFI specific) \n \n \n Boot order \n Storage devices (USB drives, hard drives, floppy drives, optical drives) \n Built-in ports (SATA, eSATA, PATA, USB, IEEE-1394, serial, parallel, PS/2) \n AGP, PCI, PCIe slots \n Integrated chipsets (audio, video, network) \n Virtualization \n Clock speed \n Memory (RAM) \n Power management \n Intrusion detection \n Passwords and encryption \n PC health tools (temperature, voltage, etc.) \n Direct access to the web or other services without booting computer (UEFI specific) \n \n When the power button is pressed on the computer, the first step in the boot process is the power-on self-test, called the\xa0 POST . Once a successful POST occurs, the BIOS reads the settings from the CMOS, and the BIOS looks for an operating system from the configured boot devices. Once it finds the operating system, the operating system’s boot loader begins the operating system boot process, and turns over control of the computer to the operating system. \n \n \n BIOS配置以下設置： \n \n 啟動順序 \n 儲存設備（USB驅動器，硬碟驅動器，軟碟驅動器，光碟驅動器） \n 內置街口（SATA，eSATA，PATA，USB，IEEE-1394，串行，並行，PS / 2） \n AGP，PCI，PCIe插槽 \n 集成芯片組（音頻，視頻，網絡） \n 虛擬化 \n 時脈速度 \n 記憶體（RAM） \n 能源管理 \n 入侵檢測 \n 密碼和加密 \n PC健康工具（溫度，電壓等） \n 直接讀取Web或其他服務，而無需啟動電腦（特定於UEFI） \n \n \n 啟動順序 \n 儲存設備（USB驅動器，硬碟驅動器，軟碟驅動器，光碟驅動器） \n 內置街口（SATA，eSATA，PATA，USB，IEEE-1394，串行，並行，PS / 2） \n AGP，PCI，PCIe插槽 \n 集成芯片組（音頻，視頻，網絡） \n 虛擬化 \n 時脈速度 \n 記憶體（RAM） \n 能源管理 \n 入侵檢測 \n 密碼和加密 \n PC健康工具（溫度，電壓等） \n 直接讀取Web或其他服務，而無需啟動電腦（特定於UEFI） \n \n 當按下計電腦上的電源按鈕時，引導過程的第一步是開機自檢，稱為POST。成功進行POST後，BIOS從CMOS讀取設定，BIOS從配置的啟動設備中查找操作系統。找到操作系統後，操作系統的啟動加載程序將開始進行操作系統啟動過程，並將電腦的控制權移交給系統。 \n \xa0 \n The boot process: \n \n Power on computer. \n BIOS performs power-on self-test (POST). \n BIOS reads settings from CMOS. \n BIOS looks for operating system from configured boot device. \n \n \n Power on computer. \n BIOS performs power-on self-test (POST). \n BIOS reads settings from CMOS. \n BIOS looks for operating system from configured boot device. \n \n 啟動過程： \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 1.開啟電腦電源。 \n \n BIOS執行開機自檢（POST）。 \n BIOS從CMOS讀取設定。 \n \n \n BIOS執行開機自檢（POST）。 \n BIOS從CMOS讀取設定。 \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 4. BIOS從配置的啟動設備中尋找系統。 \n CMOS \n The CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) is a battery-powered memory chip. It is nonvolatile memory that stores the BIOS settings and is built into the motherboard. As long as battery power remains, DC (direct current) is provided to the CMOS and allows the settings to be retained. If the computer is constantly losing the settings, the battery will need to be replaced. Older CMOS battery models used the DS12887A battery or AA-sized 3.6 volt Eternacell battery, and normally lasted approximately three years. Newer CMOS models include an internal lithium-ion battery that can last for up to 10 years. The most typical current external battery used is the CR2032, which resembles a standard watch battery. When the battery begins to fail, the first sign to the user is that the system clock frequently loses time. \n \n \n CMOS（互補金屬氧化物半導體）是電池供電的存儲芯片。 它是非易失性儲存器，用於儲存BIOS設置，並內置在主機板中。 只要電池還有電，就會向CMOS提供DC（直流電）並保留設定。 如果電腦不斷丟失設定，則需要更換電池。 較舊的CMOS電池型號使用DS12887A電池或AA尺寸的3.6伏Eternacell電池，通常可以使用大約三年。 較新的CMOS型號包括內置鋰離子電池，該電池可使用長達10年。 當前使用的最典型的外部電池是CR2032，它類似於標準的手錶電池。 當電池開始出現故障時，向用戶顯示的第一個信號是系統時鐘經常失準。 \n To change the settings in the CMOS, the user needs to enter the BIOS. To do this, the user must press a valid key or key combination during the boot process as set by the computer manufacturer. The most common keys used to enter the BIOS are F2 and/or Delete. Typically, the keystroke required to enter the BIOS is displayed on the monitor during the boot process. If the keystroke isn’t displayed, a quick search of the manufacturer’s website will often tell the user the required keystroke to enter the BIOS. \n \n \n The BIOS interface and the keystrokes to enter the BIOS change depending on the BIOS manufacturer. Below are images of the BIOS interface from two different manufacturers. Notice that while the information available is consistent between the two, the interface is slightly different. \n 要更改CMOS中的設定，用戶需要進入BIOS。 為此，用戶必須在電腦製造商設置的啟動過程中按下有效的按鍵或組合鍵。 用於進入BIOS的最常用的按鍵是F2和/或Delete。 通常，在啟動過程中，進入BIOS所需的按鍵將顯示在顯示器上。 如果未顯示按鍵，則搜尋製造商的網站通常會告訴用戶進入BIOS所使用的按鍵。 \n BIOS界面和用於進入BIOS的按鍵取決於BIOS製造商。 下面是來自兩個不同製造商的BIOS接口的圖像。 請注意，儘管兩者之間的可用訊息是一致的，但界面略有不同。 \n \n \n \n Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) \n Traditionally, there was only a single type of BIOS, which relied fully on text-based menus and the keyboard for input. More recently, most BIOS manufacturers have switched to the unified extensible firmware interface, or\xa0 UEFI . This updated BIOS allows for both keyboard and mouse input, and provides a\xa0 GUI\xa0 instead of the standard text-based menus; support for GUID partition tables ( GPT ) allowing access to disks up to 2 TB and backward compatibility to legacy partition structures (such as the master boot record ( MBR ) and Linux\'s GRand Unified Bootloader ( GRUB ); boot from removable media; a user interface allowing for online connectivity for web access, diagnostics, and file management; and\xa0 Secure Boot \xa0which protects pre-operating system code from modification. Some of these UEFI BIOS also include software that allows the user to surf the Internet, play basic games, and use backup programs without ever entering the normal operating system. \n \n 統一可擴展韌體接口（UEFI） \n \n 傳統上，只有一種類型的BIOS，它完全依賴基於文本的選單和用於輸入的鍵盤。 最近，大多數BIOS製造商已切換到統一的可擴展韌體接口或UEFI。 此更新的BIOS允許鍵盤和滑鼠輸入，並提供GUI而不是標準的基於文本的選單。 支持GUID分區表（GPT），允許讀取最大2 TB的磁盤，並向後兼容舊分區結構（例如主啟動記錄（MBR）和Linux的GRand Unified Bootloader（GRUB）；從可移動媒體啟動；用戶界面） 允許在線連接以進行Web讀取、診斷和檔案管理；以及安全啟動（Secure Boot），可防止操作系統前代碼被修改；其中某些UEFI BIOS還包括允許用戶上網，玩基本遊戲和使用的軟體。 無需進入正常操作系統即可備份程式。 \n Automatic Configuring of BIOS/CMOS \n Automatic configuration is a feature of some BIOS. While automatic BIOS configuration does not always create the most optimal settings, it can be quite useful if major errors are occurring to create a safe rollback to a known good state. Automatic configuration options include the BIOS defaults (original/failsafe settings) and setup defaults (optimal settings). There is often a turbo setup, which works toward a quick configuration for a faster system. Automatic configuration of the BIOS is often useful while troubleshooting a system. \n \n \n 自動配置BIOS / CMOS \n 自動配置是某些BIOS的功能。 儘管自動BIOS配置並非總能創建最佳設置，但是如果發生重大錯誤將安全回復創建到已知的良好狀態，它可能會非常有用。 自動配置選項包括BIOS默認設定（原始/故障安全設置）和設定默認設定（最佳設定）。 通常有一個turbo設置，可以快速配置以實現更快的系統。 在對系統進行故障排除時，BIOS的自動配置通常很有用。 \n When power is turned on, the POST (power-on self-test) is the diagnostic testing sequence that a computer\'s basic input/output system (or "starting program") runs to determine if the computer keyboard, random access memory, disk drives, and other hardware are working correctly. The POST is the initial test performed by the BIOS upon booting. The role of the POST is to find errors in hardware, and report those errors. The POST checks the following: \n \n CPU and parts of BIOS \n System time \n Video display card \n Memory \n Keyboard \n Disk drives \n \n \n CPU and parts of BIOS \n System time \n Video display card \n Memory \n Keyboard \n Disk drives \n \n If the necessary hardware is detected and found to be operating properly, the computer begins to boot. If the hardware is not detected or is found not to be operating properly, the BIOS issues an error message. This error message may be text on the display screen and/or a series of coded beeps, depending on the nature of the problem. Since the POST runs before the computer\'s video card is activated, it may not be possible to progress to the display screen. The pattern of beeps may be a variable number of short beeps or a mixture of long and short beeps, depending on what type of BIOS is installed. The pattern of beeps contains messages about the nature of the problem detected. For example, if the keyboard is not detected, a particular pattern of beeps will inform you of that fact. An error found in the POST is usually fatal (that is, it causes the current program to stop running) and will halt the boot process, since the hardware checked is absolutely essential for the computer\'s functions. \n 開機時，POST（開機自檢）是電腦基本輸入/輸出系統（或“啟動程序”）運行以確定電腦鍵盤，隨機存取存儲器，磁碟驅動器的診斷測試順序。 ，並且其他硬體運行正常。 POST是BIOS在啟動時執行的初始測試。 POST的作用是查找硬體錯誤，並報告這些錯誤。 POST檢查以下內容： \n \n CPU和部分BIOS \n 系統時間 \n 影像顯示卡 \n 記憶體 \n 鍵盤 \n 磁碟驅動器 \n \n \n CPU和部分BIOS \n 系統時間 \n 影像顯示卡 \n 記憶體 \n 鍵盤 \n 磁碟驅動器 \n \n 如果檢測到必要的硬體並發現其運行正常，則電腦將開始啟動。如果未檢測到硬體或發現硬體運行不正常，BIOS將發出錯誤訊息。根據問題的性質，此錯誤訊息可能是顯示器上的文字和/或一系列編碼的嗶聲。由於POST在啟動電腦的顯示卡之前運行，因此可能無法進入顯示螢幕。嗶聲的模式可以是可變數目的短嗶聲，也可以是長短嗶聲的混合，具體取決於安裝的BIOS類型。嗶聲的模式包含有關所檢測問題性質的訊息。例如，如果未檢測到鍵盤，則特定的嗶嗶聲將告知您該情況。在POST中發現的錯誤通常是致命的（也就是說，它導致當前程序停止運行），並且將終止啟動過程，因為檢查的硬體對於電腦的功能是絕對必要的。 \n \n The pattern of beeps is like Morse code. The number and sequence of beeps has a meaning set by the computer manufacturer. Therefore, the meaning of each beep differs by manufacturer. A chart that includes some AMI and Dell beep codes is shown below. \n \xa0 \n BEEP CODE COMPARISON CHART \n \n \n \n \n BEEP CODE \n \n \n AMI \n \n \n DELL \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1 \n \n \n DRAM refresh failure \n \n \n BIOS ROM corruption or failure \n \n \n \n \n 2 \n \n \n Parity circuit failure \n \n \n RAM not detected \n \n \n \n \n 3 \n \n \n Base 64K RAM failure \n \n \n Motherboard failure \n \n \n \n \n 4 \n \n \n System timer failure \n \n \n RAM failure \n \n \n \n \n 5 \n \n \n Process failure \n \n \n CMOS battery failure \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n BEEP CODE \n \n \n AMI \n \n \n DELL \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1 \n \n \n DRAM refresh failure \n \n \n BIOS ROM corruption or failure \n \n \n \n \n 2 \n \n \n Parity circuit failure \n \n \n RAM not detected \n \n \n \n \n 3 \n \n \n Base 64K RAM failure \n \n \n Motherboard failure \n \n \n \n \n 4 \n \n \n System timer failure \n \n \n RAM failure \n \n \n \n \n 5 \n \n \n Process failure \n \n \n CMOS battery failure \n \n \n \n \n BEEP CODE \n AMI \n DELL \n 1 \n DRAM refresh failure \n BIOS ROM corruption or failure \n 2 \n Parity circuit failure \n RAM not detected \n 3 \n Base 64K RAM failure \n Motherboard failure \n 4 \n System timer failure \n RAM failure \n 5 \n Process failure \n CMOS battery failure \n BEEP CODE \n AMI \n DELL \n 1 \n DRAM refresh failure \n BIOS ROM corruption or failure \n 2 \n Parity circuit failure \n RAM not detected \n 3 \n Base 64K RAM failure \n Motherboard failure \n 4 \n System timer failure \n RAM failure \n 5 \n Process failure \n CMOS battery failure \n BEEP CODE \n AMI \n DELL \n 1 \n DRAM refresh failure \n BIOS ROM corruption or failure \n 2 \n Parity circuit failure \n RAM not detected \n 3 \n Base 64K RAM failure \n Motherboard failure \n 4 \n System timer failure \n RAM failure \n 5 \n Process failure \n CMOS battery failure \n 嗶聲的模式類似於摩斯密碼。 嗶聲的數量和順序具有電腦製造商設定的含義。 因此，每個嗶嗶聲的含義因製造商而異。 包含一些AMI和Dell嗶聲代碼的圖表如下所示。 \n \xa0 \n 蜂鳴碼比較表 \n \n \n \n \n 嗶聲代碼 \n \n \n AMI \n \n \n DELL \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1 \n \n \n DRAM刷新失敗 \n \n \n BIOS ROM損壞或故障 \n \n \n \n \n 2 \n \n \n 奇偶校驗電路故障 \n \n \n 未檢測到RAM \n \n \n \n \n 3 \n \n \n 基本64K RAM故障 \n \n \n 主機板故障 \n \n \n \n \n 4 \n \n \n 系統計時器故障 \n \n \n RAM 故障 \n \n \n \n \n 5 \n \n \n 處理失敗 \n \n \n CMOS電池故障 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 嗶聲代碼 \n \n \n AMI \n \n \n DELL \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1 \n \n \n DRAM刷新失敗 \n \n \n BIOS ROM損壞或故障 \n \n \n \n \n 2 \n \n \n 奇偶校驗電路故障 \n \n \n 未檢測到RAM \n \n \n \n \n 3 \n \n \n 基本64K RAM故障 \n \n \n 主機板故障 \n \n \n \n \n 4 \n \n \n 系統計時器故障 \n \n \n RAM 故障 \n \n \n \n \n 5 \n \n \n 處理失敗 \n \n \n CMOS電池故障 \n \n \n \n \n 嗶聲代碼 \n AMI \n DELL \n 1 \n DRAM刷新失敗 \n BIOS ROM損壞或故障 \n 2 \n 奇偶校驗電路故障 \n 未檢測到RAM \n 3 \n 基本64K RAM故障 \n 主機板故障 \n 4 \n 系統計時器故障 \n RAM 故障 \n 5 \n 處理失敗 \n CMOS電池故障 \n 嗶聲代碼 \n AMI \n DELL \n 1 \n DRAM刷新失敗 \n BIOS ROM損壞或故障 \n 2 \n 奇偶校驗電路故障 \n 未檢測到RAM \n 3 \n 基本64K RAM故障 \n 主機板故障 \n 4 \n 系統計時器故障 \n RAM 故障 \n 5 \n 處理失敗 \n CMOS電池故障 \n 嗶聲代碼 \n AMI \n DELL \n 1 \n DRAM刷新失敗 \n BIOS ROM損壞或故障 \n 2 \n 奇偶校驗電路故障 \n 未檢測到RAM \n 3 \n 基本64K RAM故障 \n 主機板故障 \n 4 \n 系統計時器故障 \n RAM 故障 \n 5 \n 處理失敗 \n CMOS電池故障 \n EXAMPLE \n Here is a sample beep code from a computer having a problem: \n This beep code consists of two short beeps. What does this POST beep sequence mean? It depends on the BIOS’s manufacturer. \n Use a search engine to search for "AMI beep codes."\xa0 This might be a typical result. \xa0This website tells us that on an AMI computer, two short beeps indicate a memory parity error. \n Now search for "AST Research BIOS beep codes."\xa0 Here is a typical result. \xa0This website tells us that on an AST Research BIOS computer, two short beeps indicate a keyboard controller buffer failure. \n An Internet search for "IBM bios beep codes" would indicate that this beep code indicates a POST error, and that you should review the screen for the error code. \n Knowing the BIOS manufacturer is important when diagnosing a problem during the POST, as the meaning of the beep codes vary by manufacturer. \n 範例 \n 嗶聲代碼 \n 這是有問題的電腦發出的嗶嗶代碼範例： \n 此蜂鳴聲代碼包含兩個短蜂鳴聲。 這個POST嗶嗶聲序列是什麼意思？ 這取決於BIOS的製造商。 \n 使用搜尋引擎搜尋“ AMI蜂鳴聲代碼”。 這可能是典型的結果。 該網站告訴我們，在AMI計算機上，兩聲短促的嗶嗶聲表示內存奇偶校驗錯誤。 \n 現在搜尋“ AST Research BIOS嗶聲代碼”。 這是一個典型的結果。 該網站告訴我們，在AST Research BIOS計算機上，兩聲短促的嗶嗶聲表示鍵盤控制器緩衝區故障。 \n 如果在Internet上搜尋“ IBM bios嗶聲代碼”，則表明該嗶聲代碼指示POST錯誤，因此您應該在螢幕上查看錯誤代碼。 \n 在POST中診斷問題時，了解BIOS製造商很重要，因為嗶嗶代碼的含義因製造商而異。 \n So how is the BIOS updated? Recall that BIOS is firmware, or software on a chip. BIOS needs updating when there are power management issues or a processor is upgraded. Always check the manufacturer’s website for the latest firmware version. In the old systems (1980s-1990s), the actual BIOS chip had to be replaced entirely. In newer systems, the BIOS is “flashed.” Flashing is a special process in which the BIOS is overwritten, and shouldn’t be done unless absolutely necessary. Always be sure to back up information before doing a BIOS flash; if a flash doesn’t occur successfully, the system can be irrevocably broken to the point that it will no longer boot. \n \n \n 那麼如何更新BIOS？ 回想一下，BIOS是硬體或芯片上的軟體。 出現電源管理問題或升級處理器時，BIOS需要更新。 請經常在製造商的網站上查看最新硬體版本。 在舊系統（1980年代至1990年代）中，實際的BIOS芯片必須完全更換。 在較新的系統中，BIOS被“刷新”。 刷新是一個特殊的過程，其中BIOS被覆蓋，除非絕對必要，否則不應該這樣做。 經常確保在執行BIOS刷新之前備份信息； 如果無法成功進行刷新，則系統將無法恢復，甚至無法啟動。 \n \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'PCH 6 Memory and BIOS.html'}, {'title': 'PCH 18: Laptop and Notebook Component Replacement', 'text': 'PCH 18: Laptop and Notebook Component Replacement \n Overview \n In this module, we will discuss the types of hard drives used in laptop computers, as well as how to replace or upgrade them.

These drives contain capacity speeds comparable to their larger counterparts. Smaller notebooks might use an even smaller variant that is only 1.8 inches in diameter. These drives often operate at similar speeds to their larger counterparts, but may lack the same capacity for storage. These HDDs make use of a spinning disk with magnetic storage design. \n Current laptops, especially netbooks and other laptops that require thinner, lighter, and faster storage options, use solid-state disks (SSDs) following the 2.5, 1.8, or mSata form factor. Initially, manufacturers developed a hybrid disk combining an internal disk with a form of flash storage used to speed up access times. These were faster than traditional HDDs and much less expensive than a full SSD at the time. \n SSDs contain no actual disk or moving parts. They are highly resistant to shock and movement, and have low latency and high access speeds. The performance of SSDs is far superior to traditional spinning hard disk drives, and they use less power than traditional hard disks, as well, which makes them ideal for mobile applications such as laptops and notebooks. HDD manufacturers have improved the design of SSDs, making them more resilient to I/O writes and reads and less susceptible to the failure first generation SSDs could suffer from if not configured correctly. \n In addition to traditional SATA or mSATA SSDs, many laptop manufacturers have chosen to incorporate embedded multi-media cards (eMMCs) in smaller 2-in-1 laptops, Chromebooks, or tablets that are designed with a detachable keyboard. eMMCs have faster access times than traditional HDDs, but are slower than an SSD. As the name implies, this storage device is an integrated circuit (IC) chip located on the motherboard. Currently, eMMCs most often come in either 16 GB, 32 GB or 64 GB capacity. Manufacturers most often include a micro secure digital (MicroSD) card reader and USB port to allow for external storage. \n Laptop hard drives and SSDs are generally upgradable and replaceable, but the “internal storage” label for eMMC is not. \n With HDDs and SSDs being standard form factors (2.5-inch or 1.8-inch varieties), they can easily be removed and replaced with a larger capacity or higher speed version as long as the new drive matches in physical size and connection type (SATA or mSATA). To replace a hard drive, the technician simply removes the drive in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. It is always important to check with the laptop manufacturer’s instructions on the best way to remove the drive. Some models have a direct access area from the bottom of the laptop, while others require full disassembly of the machine, including the keyboard and casing. \n 筆電硬碟 \n \n \xa0 \n 多年來，筆記本電腦的儲存裝置已經從使用非常大且需要大量電能的傳統硬碟發展到使用越來越小的變體。 \n 與台式機類似，較早的筆記本電腦使用的是IDE / PATA，但當前的技術使用的是SATA連接器，或者在mSATA的情況下直接插入主板上的端口。 \n 傳統台式機使用3.5英寸HDD，而筆記本電腦通常使用2.5英寸硬碟。這些硬碟的容量速度可與大型硬碟媲美。較小的筆記本可能會使用直徑甚至只有1.8英寸的甚至更小的變體。這些硬碟通常以與較大硬碟相似的速度運行，但可能缺少相同的儲存空間。這些硬碟使用具有磁儲存設計的旋轉磁碟。 \n 當前的筆記本電腦，尤其是輕薄筆電和其他需要更薄，更輕和更快儲存選項的筆記本電腦，使用的固態硬碟（SSD）遵循2.5、1.8或mSata尺寸規格。最初，製造商開發了一種混合磁碟，該磁碟將內部磁碟與一種用於加快讀取時間的閃存一起使用。它們比傳統的HDD更快，並且當時的價格比完整的SSD便宜得多。 \n SSD不包含實際的磁碟或活動部件。它們具有很高的抗衝擊和移動性，並具有低延遲和高讀取速度。 SSD的性能遠遠優於傳統的旋轉硬碟，並且比傳統的硬碟消耗更少的功率，這使其成為筆電和筆記本電腦等移動應用程序的理想選擇。 HDD製造商已經改進了SSD的設計，使其對I / O寫入和讀取的彈性更大，並且如果配置不正確，第一代SSD可能會遭受的故障影響較小。 \n 除了傳統的SATA或mSATA SSD之外，許多筆記本電腦製造商還選擇將嵌入式多媒體卡（eMMC）集成到較小的2合1筆記本電腦，Chromebook或配有可拆卸鍵盤的平板電腦中。 eMMC的訪問時間比傳統HDD快，但比SSD慢。顧名思義，該存儲設備是位於主板上的集成電路（IC）芯片。當前，eMMC最多具有16 GB，32 GB或64 GB的容量。製造商最常使用的是微型安全數字（MicroSD）讀卡器和USB接口，用於外部儲存。 \n 筆記本電腦硬碟和固態硬碟通常可以升級和更換，但是eMMC的“內部存儲”標籤卻不是。 \n 由於HDD和SSD是標準尺寸（2.5英寸或1.8英寸），因此只要新驅動器的物理尺寸和連接類型（SATA或mSATA）。要更換硬碟，技術人員只需按照製造商的說明卸下舊硬碟。請務必與筆記本電腦製造商的說明一起查看拆卸硬碟的最佳方法。一些型號從筆記本電腦的底部可以直接進入區域，而其他一些型號則需要完全拆卸機器，包括鍵盤和機殼。 \n \n \n Memory \n Laptops use memory modules similar to their larger desktop counterparts. In desktops, DDR, DDR2, and DDR3 RAM modules are used to upgrade our systems, based upon the memory slots provided by the motherboard, and the speed and size accepted by the motherboard. Laptops, similarly, require the proper size and speed modules for their motherboards. Therefore, it is important to check the manufacturer’s manual for a laptop. Laptop memory also comes in DDR, DDR2, and DDR3 varieties, but laptops use the SODIMM (small outline dual in-line memory module) form factor. These are much smaller, more compact versions of the standard DDR, DDR2, and DDR3 modules, but they operate at the same speed and capacity as the larger versions. \n Memory \n \n 記憶體 \n 筆記本電腦使用的記憶體模組與大型台式機相似。 在台式機中，DDR，DDR2和DDR3 RAM模組用於根據主機板提供的記憶體插槽以及主機板可接受的速度和大小來升級我們的系統。 類似地，筆記本電腦需要適合其主機板的尺寸和速度模組。 因此，請務必查看筆記本電腦的製造商手冊。 筆記本電腦記憶體還提供DDR，DDR2和DDR3等種類，但筆記本電腦使用SODIMM（小尺寸雙列直插式記憶體模塊）外形。 這些是標準DDR，DDR2和DDR3模組的更小，更緊湊的版本，但是它們以與較大版本相同的速度和容量運行。 \n 記憶體 \n Replacing and upgrading memory is a fairly simply process, similar to replacing memory in a desktop machine. First, remove the power by shutting down the laptop, removing the power cord, and (if possible) removing the battery from the laptop. Next, replace the existing memory module, or add a second one, if applicable. Some laptops, like the one shown above, have a small plastic door covering the memory slots for easy access. Others may require full disassembly to access the memory slots. In a desktop computer, the modules are inserted at a straight-up-and-down vertical angle (90 degrees), but with laptops, the modules are inserted at a 45-degree angle first. Then the modules are pushed down into place once they are fully inserted into the memory slot. This is required due to the space limitations in the laptop. \n Some laptops have a single memory slot, while others have two slots. Some laptops may have their memory soldered onto the motherboard, making upgrading or removing the memory impossible. Always check your laptop’s manual for details on how many modules your laptop will accept (if any), how many gigabytes they can be, and the speed of the modules. For example, in the bottom image below, we see a 2 GB DDR2 memory module that operates at 6400 MBps, or 800 MHz. \n \n 更換和升級記憶體是一個相當簡單的過程，類似於在台式機中更換記憶體。首先，請關閉筆記本電腦，拔下電源線，並（如果可能）從筆記本電腦中取出電池，以斷開電源。接下來，更換現有的記憶體模組，或添加第二個記憶體模組（如果適用）。某些筆記本電腦，如上圖所示，有一個小的塑膠蓋蓋住記憶體插槽，以便於使用。其他可能需要完全拆卸才能接觸記憶體插槽。在台式電腦中，模組以垂直向上和向下的垂直角度（90度）插入，但在筆記本電腦中，模組首先以45度角插入。將模組完全插入記憶體插槽後，將其向下推入到位。由於筆記本電腦的空間限制，這是必需的。 \n 一些筆記本電腦只有一個記憶體插槽，而其他筆記本電腦有兩個插槽。一些筆記本電腦的記憶體可能焊接在主板上，因此無法升級或移除記憶體。請始終查看筆記本電腦的手冊，以獲取有關筆記本電腦可以容納多少個模組（如果有），可以容納多少GB以及模組速度的詳細信息。例如，在下面的下圖中，我們看到一個2 GB DDR2記憶體模組，其工作頻率為6400 MBps或800 MHz。 \n Hard drive failures are fairly uncommon occurrences for computers overall, but in laptops they have a higher occurrence rate than in desktops. Usually, this occurs when something jars the laptop while the hard disk is working. Another cause of hard drive failure is an overheated hard drive. The hard drive, like other devices in the computer, requires adequate cooling to ensure proper operation. If the hard drive overheats, you need to check to see if the laptop is receiving adequate cooling. You can do this by making sure the air intake and fans are working properly and are not filled with dust. \n Mechanical failures and defects are another possible cause of hard drive failure in laptops and notebooks. Bad sectors in the hard disk, the motor’s failure to perform rotation, power supply issues, and many other issues can cause hard drive failures. An old hard disk may create problems, or mechanical failure can occur if you have formatted the hard disk too many times. Normally, you can hear a mechanical failure — there may be a clicking sound coming from the disk, or you will hear the disk fail to “spin up” when powered on. \n Other issues with hard drives include data becoming corrupted or invalid due to virus infection or attacks, abnormal system shutdown, accidental cancellation of a running program, frequent power failure, and many other causes. These are not issues solely in laptops; these problems can occur with both laptop and desktop models. \n To determine if a laptop hard drive has failed, you must follow a logical troubleshooting methodology. First, attempt to boot up the computer. If you cannot see the display working, then listen for the hard disk. Did you hear it “spin up” when you powered on the machine? If not, it is likely a laptop power issue and not a hard drive issue. Check the battery and the AC adapter to ensure the laptop is receiving power. \n If the laptop display did turn on, then you need to see if the operating system boots. If it does not boot, it could be a data corruption issue or a hard drive failure. First, try booting the laptop from the AC adapter instead of the battery. Did that work? If so, it may be that the battery isn’t providing enough power to spin the hard drive properly. If that does not work, next, check the BIOS to see if the hard drive is being recognized. If the drive is not recognized in the BIOS, check the physical connections (power and data cables, like IDE/PATA and SATA). If the hard drive is recognized in the BIOS, but the operating system does not boot, it could be that the data on the drive has become corrupted; therefore, the operating system may need to be reinstalled and the user data may need to be restored from backup. \n If the drive isn’t recognized by the BIOS or loading the operating system, you may have a hard drive failure. Listen to the hard drive; do you hear a mechanical clicking sound? If you do, your hard drive is likely failing and should be replaced as soon as possible. If you do not hear any clicking noises, there might be bad sectors on the disk, so perform disk maintenance procedures, such as “check disk” (CHKDSK) or “disk defragmentation” (DISK DEFRAG). \n 硬碟故障在整個電腦上很少發生，但在筆記本電腦中，其發生率要高於台式機。通常，當硬碟工作時筆記本電腦受到震動時，會發生這種情況。硬碟故障的另一個原因是硬碟過熱。與電腦中的其他設備一樣，硬碟也需要充分冷卻以確保正常運行。如果硬碟過熱，則需要檢查筆記本電腦是否受到足夠的冷卻。您可以通過確保進氣口和風扇正常工作並且沒有灰塵的方式來執行此操作。 \n \xa0 \n 機械故障和缺陷是筆電和筆記本電腦中硬碟故障的另一個可能原因。硬碟中的壞扇區，電機無法旋轉，電源問題以及許多其他問題都可能導致硬碟故障。舊的硬碟可能會造成問題，或者如果格式化硬碟的次數過多，則可能會導致機械故障。通常，您會聽到機械故障的聲音-硬盤可能會發出喀噠聲，或者您會在通電後聽到磁槃無法“旋轉”的聲音。 \n \xa0 \n 硬碟的其他問題包括由於病毒感染或攻擊，異常的系統關閉，意外取消正在運行的程序，頻繁的電源故障以及許多其他原因而導致數據損壞或無效。這些不僅僅是筆記本電腦的問題；筆記本電腦和台式機型號都可能出現這些問題。 \n \xa0 \n 要確定筆記本電腦硬碟驅動器是否發生故障，您必須遵循邏輯上的故障排除方法。首先，嘗試啟動電腦。如果螢幕無法顯示，請收聽硬碟。打開機器電源時，您是否聽到過它“旋轉”的聲音？如果沒有，則很可能是筆記本電腦電源問題，而不是硬碟問題。檢查電池和交流適配器，以確保筆記型電腦已接通電源。 \n \xa0 \n 如果筆記本電腦螢幕確實打開了，那麼您需要查看操作系統是否啟動。如果無法啟動，則可能是數據損壞問題或硬碟故障。首先，嘗試從交流適配器而不是電池啟動筆記本電腦。那行嗎？如果是這樣，則可能是電池電量不足，無法正確旋轉硬碟驅動器。如果那不起作用，則接下來，檢查BIOS以查看硬碟是否被識別。如果在BIOS中無法識別硬碟，請檢查物理連接（電源和數據電纜，例如IDE / PATA和SATA）。如果在BIOS中識別到硬碟，但操作系統無法啟動，則可能是硬碟上的資料已損壞。因此，可能需要重新安裝操作系統，並且可能需要從備份中還原用戶資料。 \n \xa0 \n 如果BIOS無法識別硬碟或無法加載操作系統，則可能是硬碟出現故障。聽一下硬碟的聲音；您聽到機械的喀噠聲嗎？如果是這樣，您的硬碟可能會發生故障，應盡快更換。如果您沒有聽到任何咔嗒聲，則可能是磁碟上的磁區損壞，請執行磁碟維護過程，例如“檢查磁碟”（CHKDSK）或“磁碟碎片整理”（DISK DEFRAG）。 \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'PCH 18: Laptop and Notebook Component Replacement.html'}, {'title': '40923239蔡育嘉-1', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': '40923239蔡育嘉-1.html'}, {'title': 'Pch 1', 'text': '\n 原文:The lab activity below is designed to help you locate and understand the purpose of the various bays and ports on a desktop PC system unit. To identify components, move your mouse pointer over the name of the component or the image. Then be sure to click on each component to see a detailed view. In the detailed view, you will be able to examine the cables of various peripherals. You also will be able to see the most common bays and the way peripherals fit into them. \n 原文:When looking at a customer’s personal computer, you must be able to easily identify the various components that make up the computer by sight. As you look at the image of the computer, you notice the various parts, such as the CD/DVD drive and the memory card reader bay. Both of these components would be classified as part of the storage subsystem. The headphone jack is used for audio output, while the microphone jack is used for audio input. The USB and FireWire ports are used for both input and output, as well as storage, depending on the device that is connected to the port. For example, if we connect a printer to the USB port, it would be used for output, but if we instead connected a mouse to the USB port, it would be used for input. \n Standardization allows for a set of rules that everyone can follow so that hardware is interoperable and software is interoperable. This increases the ability to have componentization of hardware and software, since the input and output created are standardized. For example, web pages are coded in HTML (HyperText Markup Language), which all web browsers understand. Therefore, the user can use any web browser and still get the content they are interested in viewing because of the standardization of the system. \n 原文:Componentization is the process of breaking down large and complex items into simple, reusable, and interchangeable pieces. For many years, computer software and hardware were made by individual companies building things that only worked for a single system. For example, if IBM made a network card, it would not work in a Compaq or Dell computer. Over the years, hardware developers realized that if they could agree to a set of standards, they could create components that could be built to work together using standard interfaces, which saves time, money, and complexity. This same concept is now being used in the software world under object-oriented programming — a standardized method of programming. \n The most common type of firmware found in a computer is called the BIOS (basic input/output system), which provides the computer with the most basic of tasks before the operating system is even loaded. Without the BIOS, the computer would be rather useless, as it wouldn’t even be able to read the hard drive and load the operating system. Firmware is persistent: it remains on the chip even after the power is removed, unlike temporary storage (such as RAM). \n In older generations of firmware, the firmware was not upgradable unless you replaced the physical chip, but in recent years firmware has been designed to be “flashable.” This means that the chip can be upgraded if the software is outdated or has a programming error. This firmware “flash” replaces the older software on the chip with the latest version, improving performance or enhancing security. \n 原文: Firmware is a combination of hardware and software, often called “software on a chip.” Firmware allows control of the device to which the chip is connected. A firmware chip contains specialized software and is often attached to motherboards, optical drives (such as CD, DVD, or Blu-ray), mass storage devices, and other specialized hardware. \n \n Peripheral devices consist of hardware attached to the system unit and are designated as input, output, or both. Traditional input device examples are the mouse and keyboard which are used to input data. \n Computer hardware consists of the mechanical and electrical parts of the computer. Data flows through the motherboard in what is known as the system bus. External ports, which are discussed in more detail further in this lesson, allow peripheral devices to be connected to the system unit. Common ports are USB, serial, and parallel ports. \n 原文: A computer system includes hardware, software, and firmware. To build a computer, we must first gather the required hardware. The hardware is the part of the computer that you can touch and feel. When most people see a typical computer, they understand that there are physical components to what they are using, such as the the hard metallic or plastic System unit, central processing unit (CPU), power supply, disk drives, and other essential components. Hardware is limited by its manufacture date and specifically by the motherboard installed. Depending on age and availability, some of the hardware items may be expensive to acquire, repair, or replace. For example, if the computer is running slower over time as you add newer software, it may be necessary to increase the amount of physical memory, called\xa0 RAM\xa0 (random access memory), in the computer. In order to do this, the technician would need to purchase the correct size, speed, and style of memory according to the motherboard specifications and install it in the computer which will then enhance its ability to process information more quickly. \n \n PCH 18: Laptop and Notebook Component Replacement \n Overview \n In this module, we will discuss the types of hard drives used in laptop computers, as well as how to replace or upgrade them. We will also discuss the types of memory used in laptop and notebook computers, and the difference between upgrading laptop or notebook memory and upgrading memory in a standard desktop computer. Lastly, we will discuss the types of hard drive failure you may experience with a notebook computer and the best way to identify the failure and repair it properly. \n 概覽 \n 在本模組中，我們將討論筆記型電腦中使用的硬碟類型，以及如何更換或升級它們。 我們還將討論筆電和筆記本電腦中使用的記憶體類型，以及升級筆電或筆記本電腦的記憶體與升級標準桌上型電腦中的記憶體之間的區別。 最後，我們將討論筆記本電腦可能遇到的硬碟故障類型，以及識別故障並正確修復的最佳方法。 \n Notebook Hard Drives \n Laptop storage has evolved over the years from using traditional HDDs, which are very large and require a lot of power, to using smaller and smaller variants. \n Similar to the desktop, older generation laptops used IDE/PATA, but current technology uses SATA connectors, or in the case of mSATA directly plugs into a port on the motherboard. \n Whereas traditional desktop computers use a 3.5-inch HDD, laptops typically use a 2.5-inch hard drive. These drives contain capacity speeds comparable to their larger counterparts. Smaller notebooks might use an even smaller variant that is only 1.8 inches in diameter. These drives often operate at similar speeds to their larger counterparts, but may lack the same capacity for storage. These HDDs make use of a spinning disk with magnetic storage design. \n Current laptops, especially netbooks and other laptops that require thinner, lighter, and faster storage options, use solid-state disks (SSDs) following the 2.5, 1.8, or mSata form factor. Initially, manufacturers developed a hybrid disk combining an internal disk with a form of flash storage used to speed up access times. These were faster than traditional HDDs and much less expensive than a full SSD at the time. \n SSDs contain no actual disk or moving parts. They are highly resistant to shock and movement, and have low latency and high access speeds. The performance of SSDs is far superior to traditional spinning hard disk drives, and they use less power than traditional hard disks, as well, which makes them ideal for mobile applications such as laptops and notebooks. HDD manufacturers have improved the design of SSDs, making them more resilient to I/O writes and reads and less susceptible to the failure first generation SSDs could suffer from if not configured correctly. \n In addition to traditional SATA or mSATA SSDs, many laptop manufacturers have chosen to incorporate embedded multi-media cards (eMMCs) in smaller 2-in-1 laptops, Chromebooks, or tablets that are designed with a detachable keyboard. eMMCs have faster access times than traditional HDDs, but are slower than an SSD. As the name implies, this storage device is an integrated circuit (IC) chip located on the motherboard. Currently, eMMCs most often come in either 16 GB, 32 GB or 64 GB capacity. Manufacturers most often include a micro secure digital (MicroSD) card reader and USB port to allow for external storage. \n Laptop hard drives and SSDs are generally upgradable and replaceable, but the “internal storage” label for eMMC is not. \n With HDDs and SSDs being standard form factors (2.5-inch or 1.8-inch varieties), they can easily be removed and replaced with a larger capacity or higher speed version as long as the new drive matches in physical size and connection type (SATA or mSATA). To replace a hard drive, the technician simply removes the drive in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. It is always important to check with the laptop manufacturer’s instructions on the best way to remove the drive. Some models have a direct access area from the bottom of the laptop, while others require full disassembly of the machine, including the keyboard and casing. \n \n 筆電硬碟 \n \xa0 \n 多年來，筆記本電腦的儲存裝置已經從使用非常大且需要大量電能的傳統硬碟發展到使用越來越小的變體。 \n 與台式機類似，較早的筆記本電腦使用的是IDE / PATA，但當前的技術使用的是SATA連接器，或者在mSATA的情況下直接插入主板上的端口。 \n 傳統台式機使用3.5英寸HDD，而筆記本電腦通常使用2.5英寸硬碟。這些硬碟的容量速度可與大型硬碟媲美。較小的筆記本可能會使用直徑甚至只有1.8英寸的甚至更小的變體。這些硬碟通常以與較大硬碟相似的速度運行，但可能缺少相同的儲存空間。這些硬碟使用具有磁儲存設計的旋轉磁碟。 \n 當前的筆記本電腦，尤其是輕薄筆電和其他需要更薄，更輕和更快儲存選項的筆記本電腦，使用的固態硬碟（SSD）遵循2.5、1.8或mSata尺寸規格。最初，製造商開發了一種混合磁碟，該磁碟將內部磁碟與一種用於加快讀取時間的閃存一起使用。它們比傳統的HDD更快，並且當時的價格比完整的SSD便宜得多。 \n SSD不包含實際的磁碟或活動部件。它們具有很高的抗衝擊和移動性，並具有低延遲和高讀取速度。 SSD的性能遠遠優於傳統的旋轉硬碟，並且比傳統的硬碟消耗更少的功率，這使其成為筆電和筆記本電腦等移動應用程序的理想選擇。 HDD製造商已經改進了SSD的設計，使其對I / O寫入和讀取的彈性更大，並且如果配置不正確，第一代SSD可能會遭受的故障影響較小。 \n 除了傳統的SATA或mSATA SSD之外，許多筆記本電腦製造商還選擇將嵌入式多媒體卡（eMMC）集成到較小的2合1筆記本電腦，Chromebook或配有可拆卸鍵盤的平板電腦中。 eMMC的訪問時間比傳統HDD快，但比SSD慢。顧名思義，該存儲設備是位於主板上的集成電路（IC）芯片。當前，eMMC最多具有16 GB，32 GB或64 GB的容量。製造商最常使用的是微型安全數字（MicroSD）讀卡器和USB接口，用於外部儲存。 \n 筆記本電腦硬碟和固態硬碟通常可以升級和更換，但是eMMC的“內部存儲”標籤卻不是。 \n 由於HDD和SSD是標準尺寸（2.5英寸或1.8英寸），因此只要新驅動器的物理尺寸和連接類型（SATA或mSATA）。要更換硬碟，技術人員只需按照製造商的說明卸下舊硬碟。請務必與筆記本電腦製造商的說明一起查看拆卸硬碟的最佳方法。一些型號從筆記本電腦的底部可以直接進入區域，而其他一些型號則需要完全拆卸機器，包括鍵盤和機殼。 \n Memory \n Laptops use memory modules similar to their larger desktop counterparts. In desktops, DDR, DDR2, and DDR3 RAM modules are used to upgrade our systems, based upon the memory slots provided by the motherboard, and the speed and size accepted by the motherboard. Laptops, similarly, require the proper size and speed modules for their motherboards. Therefore, it is important to check the manufacturer’s manual for a laptop. Laptop memory also comes in DDR, DDR2, and DDR3 varieties, but laptops use the SODIMM (small outline dual in-line memory module) form factor. These are much smaller, more compact versions of the standard DDR, DDR2, and DDR3 modules, but they operate at the same speed and capacity as the larger versions. \n \n 記憶體 \n 筆記本電腦使用的記憶體模組與大型台式機相似。 在台式機中，DDR，DDR2和DDR3 RAM模組用於根據主機板提供的記憶體插槽以及主機板可接受的速度和大小來升級我們的系統。 類似地，筆記本電腦需要適合其主機板的尺寸和速度模組。 因此，請務必查看筆記本電腦的製造商手冊。 筆記本電腦記憶體還提供DDR，DDR2和DDR3等種類，但筆記本電腦使用SODIMM（小尺寸雙列直插式記憶體模塊）外形。 這些是標準DDR，DDR2和DDR3模組的更小，更緊湊的版本，但是它們以與較大版本相同的速度和容量運行。 \n Replacing and upgrading memory is a fairly simply process, similar to replacing memory in a desktop machine. First, remove the power by shutting down the laptop, removing the power cord, and (if possible) removing the battery from the laptop. Next, replace the existing memory module, or add a second one, if applicable. Some laptops, like the one shown above, have a small plastic door covering the memory slots for easy access. Others may require full disassembly to access the memory slots. In a desktop computer, the modules are inserted at a straight-up-and-down vertical angle (90 degrees), but with laptops, the modules are inserted at a 45-degree angle first. Then the modules are pushed down into place once they are fully inserted into the memory slot. This is required due to the space limitations in the laptop. \n Some laptops have a single memory slot, while others have two slots. Some laptops may have their memory soldered onto the motherboard, making upgrading or removing the memory impossible. Always check your laptop’s manual for details on how many modules your laptop will accept (if any), how many gigabytes they can be, and the speed of the modules. For example, in the bottom image below, we see a 2 GB DDR2 memory module that operates at 6400 MBps, or 800 MHz. \n \n 更換和升級記憶體是一個相當簡單的過程，類似於在台式機中更換記憶體。首先，請關閉筆記本電腦，拔下電源線，並（如果可能）從筆記本電腦中取出電池，以斷開電源。接下來，更換現有的記憶體模組，或添加第二個記憶體模組（如果適用）。某些筆記本電腦，如上圖所示，有一個小的塑膠蓋蓋住記憶體插槽，以便於使用。其他可能需要完全拆卸才能接觸記憶體插槽。在台式電腦中，模組以垂直向上和向下的垂直角度（90度）插入，但在筆記本電腦中，模組首先以45度角插入。將模組完全插入記憶體插槽後，將其向下推入到位。由於筆記本電腦的空間限制，這是必需的。 \n 一些筆記本電腦只有一個記憶體插槽，而其他筆記本電腦有兩個插槽。一些筆記本電腦的記憶體可能焊接在主板上，因此無法升級或移除記憶體。請始終查看筆記本電腦的手冊，以獲取有關筆記本電腦可以容納多少個模組（如果有），可以容納多少GB以及模組速度的詳細信息。例如，在下面的下圖中，我們看到一個2 GB DDR2記憶體模組，其工作頻率為6400 MBps或800 MHz。 \n The pattern of beeps is like Morse code. The number and sequence of beeps has a meaning set by the computer manufacturer. Therefore, the meaning of each beep differs by manufacturer. A chart that includes some AMI and Dell beep codes is shown below. \n 如果檢測到必要的硬體並發現其運行正常，則電腦將開始啟動。如果未檢測到硬體或發現硬體運行不正常，BIOS將發出錯誤訊息。根據問題的性質，此錯誤訊息可能是顯示器上的文字和/或一系列編碼的嗶聲。由於POST在啟動電腦的顯示卡之前運行，因此可能無法進入顯示螢幕。嗶聲的模式可以是可變數目的短嗶聲，也可以是長短嗶聲的混合，具體取決於安裝的BIOS類型。嗶聲的模式包含有關所檢測問題性質的訊息。例如，如果未檢測到鍵盤，則特定的嗶嗶聲將告知您該情況。在POST中發現的錯誤通常是致命的（也就是說，它導致當前程序停止運行），並且將終止啟動過程，因為檢查的硬體對於電腦的功能是絕對必要的。 \n \n CPU和部分BIOS \n 系統時間 \n 影像顯示卡 \n 記憶體 \n 鍵盤 \n 磁碟驅動器 \n \n \n CPU和部分BIOS \n 系統時間 \n 影像顯示卡 \n 記憶體 \n 鍵盤 \n 磁碟驅動器 \n \n 開機時，POST（開機自檢）是電腦基本輸入/輸出系統（或“啟動程序”）運行以確定電腦鍵盤，隨機存取存儲器，磁碟驅動器的診斷測試順序。 ，並且其他硬體運行正常。 POST是BIOS在啟動時執行的初始測試。 POST的作用是查找硬體錯誤，並報告這些錯誤。 POST檢查以下內容： \n If the necessary hardware is detected and found to be operating properly, the computer begins to boot. If the hardware is not detected or is found not to be operating properly, the BIOS issues an error message. This error message may be text on the display screen and/or a series of coded beeps, depending on the nature of the problem. Since the POST runs before the computer\'s video card is activated, it may not be possible to progress to the display screen. The pattern of beeps may be a variable number of short beeps or a mixture of long and short beeps, depending on what type of BIOS is installed. The pattern of beeps contains messages about the nature of the problem detected. For example, if the keyboard is not detected, a particular pattern of beeps will inform you of that fact. An error found in the POST is usually fatal (that is, it causes the current program to stop running) and will halt the boot process, since the hardware checked is absolutely essential for the computer\'s functions. \n \n CPU and parts of BIOS \n System time \n Video display card \n Memory \n Keyboard \n Disk drives \n \n \n CPU and parts of BIOS \n System time \n Video display card \n Memory \n Keyboard \n Disk drives \n \n When power is turned on, the POST (power-on self-test) is the diagnostic testing sequence that a computer\'s basic input/output system (or "starting program") runs to determine if the computer keyboard, random access memory, disk drives, and other hardware are working correctly. The POST is the initial test performed by the BIOS upon booting. The role of the POST is to find errors in hardware, and report those errors. The POST checks the following: \n 自動配置是某些BIOS的功能。 儘管自動BIOS配置並非總能創建最佳設置，但是如果發生重大錯誤將安全回復創建到已知的良好狀態，它可能會非常有用。 自動配置選項包括BIOS默認設定（原始/故障安全設置）和設定默認設定（最佳設定）。 通常有一個turbo設置，可以快速配置以實現更快的系統。 在對系統進行故障排除時，BIOS的自動配置通常很有用。 \n 自動配置BIOS / CMOS \n \n Automatic configuration is a feature of some BIOS. While automatic BIOS configuration does not always create the most optimal settings, it can be quite useful if major errors are occurring to create a safe rollback to a known good state. Automatic configuration options include the BIOS defaults (original/failsafe settings) and setup defaults (optimal settings). There is often a turbo setup, which works toward a quick configuration for a faster system. Automatic configuration of the BIOS is often useful while troubleshooting a system. \n Automatic Configuring of BIOS/CMOS \n 傳統上，只有一種類型的BIOS，它完全依賴基於文本的選單和用於輸入的鍵盤。 最近，大多數BIOS製造商已切換到統一的可擴展韌體接口或UEFI。 此更新的BIOS允許鍵盤和滑鼠輸入，並提供GUI而不是標準的基於文本的選單。 支持GUID分區表（GPT），允許讀取最大2 TB的磁盤，並向後兼容舊分區結構（例如主啟動記錄（MBR）和Linux的GRand Unified Bootloader（GRUB）；從可移動媒體啟動；用戶界面） 允許在線連接以進行Web讀取、診斷和檔案管理；以及安全啟動（Secure Boot），可防止操作系統前代碼被修改；其中某些UEFI BIOS還包括允許用戶上網，玩基本遊戲和使用的軟體。 無需進入正常操作系統即可備份程式。 \n 當按下計電腦上的電源按鈕時，引導過程的第一步是開機自檢，稱為POST。成功進行POST後，BIOS從CMOS讀取設定，BIOS從配置的啟動設備中查找操作系統。找到操作系統後，操作系統的啟動加載程序將開始進行操作系統啟動過程，並將電腦的控制權移交給系統。 \n \n 啟動順序 \n 儲存設備（USB驅動器，硬碟驅動器，軟碟驅動器，光碟驅動器） \n 內置街口（SATA，eSATA，PATA，USB，IEEE-1394，串行，並行，PS / 2） \n AGP，PCI，PCIe插槽 \n 集成芯片組（音頻，視頻，網絡） \n 虛擬化 \n 時脈速度 \n 記憶體（RAM） \n 能源管理 \n 入侵檢測 \n 密碼和加密 \n PC健康工具（溫度，電壓等） \n 直接讀取Web或其他服務，而無需啟動電腦（特定於UEFI） \n \n \n 啟動順序 \n 儲存設備（USB驅動器，硬碟驅動器，軟碟驅動器，光碟驅動器） \n 內置街口（SATA，eSATA，PATA，USB，IEEE-1394，串行，並行，PS / 2） \n AGP，PCI，PCIe插槽 \n 集成芯片組（音頻，視頻，網絡） \n 虛擬化 \n 時脈速度 \n 記憶體（RAM） \n 能源管理 \n 入侵檢測 \n 密碼和加密 \n PC健康工具（溫度，電壓等） \n 直接讀取Web或其他服務，而無需啟動電腦（特定於UEFI） \n \n BIOS配置以下設置： \n \n When the power button is pressed on the computer, the first step in the boot process is the power-on self-test, called the\xa0 POST . Once a successful POST occurs, the BIOS reads the settings from the CMOS, and the BIOS looks for an operating system from the configured boot devices. Once it finds the operating system, the operating system’s boot loader begins the operating system boot process, and turns over control of the computer to the operating system. \n \n Boot order \n Storage devices (USB drives, hard drives, floppy drives, optical drives) \n Built-in ports (SATA, eSATA, PATA, USB, IEEE-1394, serial, parallel, PS/2) \n AGP, PCI, PCIe slots \n Integrated chipsets (audio, video, network) \n Virtualization \n Clock speed \n Memory (RAM) \n Power management \n Intrusion detection \n Passwords and encryption \n PC health tools (temperature, voltage, etc.) \n Direct access to the web or other services without booting computer (UEFI specific) \n \n \n Boot order \n Storage devices (USB drives, hard drives, floppy drives, optical drives) \n Built-in ports (SATA, eSATA, PATA, USB, IEEE-1394, serial, parallel, PS/2) \n AGP, PCI, PCIe slots \n Integrated chipsets (audio, video, network) \n Virtualization \n Clock speed \n Memory (RAM) \n Power management \n Intrusion detection \n Passwords and encryption \n PC health tools (temperature, voltage, etc.) \n Direct access to the web or other services without booting computer (UEFI specific) \n \n BIOS configures the following settings: \n 更改BIOS時要非常小心。 不正確的設置可能會使您的電腦無法啟動。 \n BIOS用於配置通用設定，例如電腦讀取設備的順序。 此命令稱為引導命令。 此外，BIOS還用於配置打開和關閉各種輸入/輸出端口的設定，以及各種CPU設置（例如虛擬化和超頻）的配定。 \n 了解BIOS和CMOS \n \n Be very careful when making changes to the BIOS. Incorrect settings may keep your computer from booting. \n The BIOS is used to configure common settings, such as the order in which devices are read by the computer. This order is known as the boot order. In addition, the BIOS is also used in the configuration of settings that turn on and off various input/output ports, and the configuration of various CPU settings such as virtualization \xa0and\xa0 overclocking \xa0. \n Understanding BIOS and CMOS \n BIOS是允許用戶更改設置的程序，而設置本身則存儲在互補金屬氧化物半導體或CMOS中。 CMOS是電池供電的存儲芯片。 \n 電腦的BIOS是最常見的韌體示例。 韌體是芯片上的軟體，是韌體啟動時電腦運行的第一個軟體。 BIOS具有多個角色，包括執行開機自檢，該自檢將測試並初始化處理器，顯示卡，磁碟驅動器和連接器。 BIOS還包括用於電腦的基本“操作系統”，它使電腦可以從最基本的組件（包括鍵盤，滑鼠和磁碟驅動器）獲取輸入並提供輸出。 BIOS存儲在ROM（唯讀記憶體）芯片中，但可以通過過程調用“刷新”進行升級。 \n \n While the BIOS is a program that allows the user to make changes to the settings, the settings themselves are stored in the complementary metal-oxide semiconductor, or\xa0 CMOS . The CMOS is a battery-powered memory chip. \n A computer’s BIOS is the most common example of\xa0 firmware . Firmware is software on a chip, and is the first software run by the computer when the machine is booted up. The BIOS has several roles, including performing the power-on self-test, which tests and initializes the processor, video card, disk drives, and adapters. The BIOS also includes the low-level “operating system” for the computer, which allows the computer to take input from and give output to the most basic components, including the keyboard, mouse, and disk drives. The BIOS is stored in a ROM (Read-only memory) chip, but can be upgraded through a process call “flashing.” \n To explore more about how to install RAM, visit\xa0 www.wikihow.com/Install-RAM . \n Important note: Never touch the gold connectors on the modules! Corrosion of the contacts can occur, or the module may be damaged due to electrostatic discharge. \n \n Always ensure you take proper ESD (electrostatic discharge) protection measures to ensure both the motherboard and memory modules are not harmed during installation. \n Turn off the computer and unplug the power cord. \n Open the case and begin the installation of the memory sticks. Always hold the memory sticks by the sides of the chips and never by the gold contacts. \n Line up the memory module’s connector with the slot on the motherboard. \n Verify that the locking tabs are in the open position. \n Push the module straight down until the tabs swivel to the locking position (this takes force). \n \n \n Always ensure you take proper ESD (electrostatic discharge) protection measures to ensure both the motherboard and memory modules are not harmed during installation. \n Turn off the computer and unplug the power cord. \n Open the case and begin the installation of the memory sticks.

To determine if the data has been corrected or changed from the original data as a result of parity, examine the full transmitted data string, including the parity bit. \n 偵錯碼（ECC）使奇偶校驗概念更進一步，不僅可以識別錯誤，還可以糾正問題。 要確定是否由於奇偶校驗而對原始數據進行了校正或更改，請檢查完整的傳輸資料字符串，包括奇偶校驗位。 \n \n \n \n \n 原始資料 \n \n \n “ 1 ”位的計數 \n \n \n 傳輸的位元（8 位或9 位，取決於原始位元的數量），包括奇偶校驗 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 偶校驗 \n \n \n 奇校驗 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 0000000 \n \n \n 0 \n \n \n 0000000 0 \n \n \n 0000000 1 \n \n \n \n \n 0101101 \n \n \n 4 \n \n \n 0101101 0 \n \n \n 0101101 1 \n \n \n \n \n 0101010 \n \n \n 3 \n \n \n 0101010 1 \n \n \n 0101010 0 \n \n \n \n \n 10000000 \n \n \n 1 \n \n \n 1000000 1 \n \n \n 10000000 0 \n \n \n \n \n 11111100 \n \n \n 6 \n \n \n 11111100 0 \n \n \n 11111100 1 \n \n \n \n \n 10001100 \n \n \n 3 \n \n \n 10001100 1 \n \n \n 10001100 0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Original data \n \n \n Count of “1” bits \n \n \n Bits transmitted (8 or 9, depending on number of original bits), including parity \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Even Parity \n \n \n Odd Parity \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 0000000 \n \n \n 0 \n \n \n 0000000 0 \n \n \n 0000000 1 \n \n \n \n \n 0101101 \n \n \n 4 \n \n \n 0101101 0 \n \n \n 0101101 1 \n \n \n \n \n 0101010 \n \n \n 3 \n \n \n 0101010 1 \n \n \n 0101010 0 \n \n \n \n \n 10000000 \n \n \n 1 \n \n \n 1000000 1 \n \n \n 10000000 0 \n \n \n \n \n 11111100 \n \n \n 6 \n \n \n 11111100 0 \n \n \n 11111100 1 \n \n \n \n \n 10001100 \n \n \n 3 \n \n \n 10001100 1 \n \n \n 10001100 0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 由於所有軟體錯誤中約有90％是單位原類型的，因此奇偶校驗通常在大多數情況下就足夠了。 不幸的是，由於要花費額外的時間週期來計算、存儲和讀取奇偶校驗位，因此錯誤檢查要付出一定的代價，這會稍微降低性能。 另一個考慮因素是，由於無法通過奇偶校驗解決錯誤，因此實際上必須停止應用程序，並發出一條錯誤消息，指出遇到奇偶校驗錯誤。 \n Odd Parity \n Even Parity \n Bits transmitted (8 or 9, depending on number of original bits), including parity \n Count of “1” bits \n Original data \n \n \n \n \n Original data \n \n \n Count of “1” bits \n \n \n Bits transmitted (8 or 9, depending on number of original bits), including parity \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Even Parity \n \n \n Odd Parity \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 0000000 \n \n \n 0 \n \n \n 0000000 0 \n \n \n 0000000 1 \n \n \n \n \n 0101101 \n \n \n 4 \n \n \n 0101101 0 \n \n \n 0101101 1 \n \n \n \n \n 0101010 \n \n \n 3 \n \n \n 0101010 1 \n \n \n 0101010 0 \n \n \n \n \n 10000000 \n \n \n 1 \n \n \n 1000000 1 \n \n \n 10000000 0 \n \n \n \n \n 11111100 \n \n \n 6 \n \n \n 11111100 0 \n \n \n 11111100 1 \n \n \n \n \n 10001100 \n \n \n 3 \n \n \n 10001100 1 \n \n \n 10001100 0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Original data \n \n \n Count of “1” bits \n \n \n Bits transmitted (8 or 9, depending on number of original bits), including parity \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Even Parity \n \n \n Odd Parity \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 0000000 \n \n \n 0 \n \n \n 0000000 0 \n \n \n 0000000 1 \n \n \n \n \n 0101101 \n \n \n 4 \n \n \n 0101101 0 \n \n \n 0101101 1 \n \n \n \n \n 0101010 \n \n \n 3 \n \n \n 0101010 1 \n \n \n 0101010 0 \n \n \n \n \n 10000000 \n \n \n 1 \n \n \n 1000000 1 \n \n \n 10000000 0 \n \n \n \n \n 11111100 \n \n \n 6 \n \n \n 11111100 0 \n \n \n 11111100 1 \n \n \n \n \n 10001100 \n \n \n 3 \n \n \n 10001100 1 \n \n \n 10001100 0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Original data \n \n \n Count of “1” bits \n \n \n Bits transmitted (8 or 9, depending on number of original bits), including parity \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Even Parity \n \n \n Odd Parity \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 0000000 \n \n \n 0 \n \n \n 0000000 0 \n \n \n 0000000 1 \n \n \n \n \n 0101101 \n \n \n 4 \n \n \n 0101101 0 \n \n \n 0101101 1 \n \n \n \n \n 0101010 \n \n \n 3 \n \n \n 0101010 1 \n \n \n 0101010 0 \n \n \n \n \n 10000000 \n \n \n 1 \n \n \n 1000000 1 \n \n \n 10000000 0 \n \n \n \n \n 11111100 \n \n \n 6 \n \n \n 11111100 0 \n \n \n 11111100 1 \n \n \n \n \n 10001100 \n \n \n 3 \n \n \n 10001100 1 \n \n \n 10001100 0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Since about 90 percent of all\xa0 soft errors\xa0 are of the single bit kind, parity checking is usually quite sufficient for most situations. Unfortunately, there is a penalty to be paid for error checking, which is slightly slower performance, since there are extra clock cycles spent in calculating, storing, and fetching the parity bit. One other consideration is that since the error cannot be fixed by parity, the application must actually be stopped and an error message issued indicating that a parity error was encountered. \n Rambus RAM（RDRAM）也被稱為RIMM（Rambus嵌入式存儲模組）。這些模組具有184針變種（16位版本）和232針變種（32位版本）。主板上的每個空插槽都必須在其中放置一個連續性模組（CRIMM），否則主板將無法正確識別內存。在最近的系統中未使用此功能，但在Pentium 4系統中大量使用了此功能。 RDRAM以MBps為單位進行度量，例如RIMM 4200（或4200 MBps）。 \n DDR3 SDRAM被稱為雙倍資料傳輸率3 SDRAM，是當今使用的最新一代SDRAM。它在較低的電壓下運行，並且比DDR2更快，但是與之前的DDR2模組相比，延遲又增加了。這些模組也具有240個針腳，但是它們的“鍵控”與DDR2不同。 “鍵控”部分是針腳之間的間隙所在的位置，因此只有DDR2可以插入DDR2插槽，而DDR3只能插入DDR3插槽。這些的常用符號是PC3-10600，其中10600是MBps的速度。 \n DDR2 SDRAM是雙倍數據速率SDRAM，具有更高的延遲，但對外部總線的讀取速度更快。這些芯片具有240個針腳以將其模組連接到插槽，並且還以MBps額定，例如PC2-4200，即4200 MBps（或4.2 GBps）。 \n 儘管SDRAM的性能與主板總線相同，但CPU的運行速度比主板總線快許多倍。 DDR SDRAM代表雙倍數據速率同步動態隨機存取存儲器。這種類型的存儲器可以在每個時段週期兩次傳輸數據，從而使速度比傳統SDRAM快一倍。這些芯片有184引腳的型號，額定為MBps（吞吐量）。一個很好的例子就是PC-1600，吞吐量為1600 MBps。 \n SDRAM或同步DRAM是第一個以與主板總線相同的速度運行的內存。最初的芯片是168針雙列直插式內存模組，其速度額定為MHz。常見的命名約定包括PC-66（相當於66 Mhz），PC-133或PC-266。 \n SRAM或靜態RAM解決了持續刷新的問題，但製造成本很高。因此，SRAM僅用於非常高速的需求，例如1級，2級和3級CPU高速緩存，硬碟緩衝區和LCD螢幕緩衝區。 \n 在不同時間裡，使用的RAM是不同類型。了解所有這些信息非常重要，因為許多公司是舊系統和最新系統混合使用。 DRAM或動態RAM是最古老的類型之一。它需要經常刷新內容。 DRAM將數據或程序代碼的每一位存儲在由電容器和晶體管組成的存儲單元中，並且通常以矩形配置的存儲單元來組織。 DRAM處存單元是動態的，因為它需要每幾毫秒刷新一次或給其提供新的電荷，以補償電容器的電荷洩漏。 \n \n Rambus direct ram (RDRAM) is also known as RIMM (Rambus in-line memory module). These modules come in a 184-pin variant (16-bit version) and a 232-pin variant (32-bit version). Each empty slot in the motherboard has to have a continuity module (CRIMM) placed inside it, or the motherboard won’t recognize the memory properly. This is not used in recent systems, but was used heavily in Pentium 4 systems. The RDRAM is measured in MBps, such as RIMM 4200 (or 4200 MBps). \n DDR3 SDRAM is known as double data rate 3 SDRAM, and is the latest generation of SDRAM in use today. It runs at a lower voltage and is faster than DDR2, but again the latency is increased over the previous DDR2 modules. These modules also have 240 pins, but they are “keyed” differently than DDR2. The “keyed” portion is where the gap in the pins is located, so only a DDR2 will fit in a DDR2 slot, and a DDR3 will fit only in a DDR3 slot. The common notation for these is PC3-10600, where the 10600 is the speed in MBps. \n DDR2 SDRAM is double double data rate SDRAM, which has a higher\xa0 latency \xa0but faster access to the external bus. These chips have 240 pins to connect their modules to the slot, and are also rated in MBps, such as PC2-4200, which is 4200 MBps (or 4.2 GBps). \n While SDRAM performs at the same speed as the motherboard’s bus, the CPU operates many times faster than the motherboard’s bus. DDR SDRAM stands for double data rate synchronous dynamic random access memory. This type of memory can transfer data two times per clock cycle, thereby doubling the speed over traditional SDRAM. These chips come in 184-pin varieties, rated in MBps (throughput). A good example of this is something like PC-1600, which is 1600 MBps throughput. \n SDRAM, or synchronous DRAM, was the first memory that operated at the same speed as the motherboard’s bus. The initial chips were 168-pin dual in-line memory modules, which have their speed rated in MHz. Common naming conventions include PC-66 (which is equivalent to 66 Mhz), or PC-133, or PC-266. \n SRAM, or static RAM, solved the issue of the need for constant refreshing, but it is quite expensive to manufacture. Therefore, SRAM is only used for very high-speed needs, such as level 1, level 2, and level 3 CPU caches, hard drive buffers, and LCD screen buffers. \n Different types of RAM have been in common use during different time periods. It is important to understand them all, because many companies use a mix of legacy systems and more current ones. DRAM, or dynamic RAM, is one of the oldest types. It requires frequent refreshing of contents. DRAM stores each bit of data or program code in a storage cell consisting of a capacitor and a transistor, and is typically organized in a rectangular configuration of storage cells. A DRAM storage cell is dynamic in that it needs to be refreshed or given a new electronic charge every few milliseconds to compensate for charge leaks from the capacitor. \n 10001100 1 \n 3 \n Motherboard failure \n Base 64K RAM failure \n 主機板故障 \n 基本64K RAM故障 \n 10001100 \n 11111100 1 \n 11111100 0 \n 6 \n 11111100 \n 10000000 0 \n 1000000 1 \n Odd number of “1” bits \n 1 \n BIOS ROM corruption or failure \n DRAM refresh failure \n 未檢測到RAM \n 奇偶校驗電路故障 \n 2 \n RAM not detected \n Parity circuit failure \n BIOS ROM損壞或故障 \n DRAM刷新失敗 \n 10000000 \n 0101010 0 \n 0101010 1 \n 3 \n 0101010 \n 0101101 1 \n 0101101 0 \n 4 \n RAM failure \n System timer failure \n \n \n \n \n 嗶聲代碼 \n \n \n AMI \n \n \n DELL \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1 \n \n \n DRAM刷新失敗 \n \n \n BIOS ROM損壞或故障 \n \n \n \n \n 2 \n \n \n 奇偶校驗電路故障 \n \n \n 未檢測到RAM \n \n \n \n \n 3 \n \n \n 基本64K RAM故障 \n \n \n 主機板故障 \n \n \n \n \n 4 \n \n \n 系統計時器故障 \n \n \n RAM 故障 \n \n \n \n \n 5 \n \n \n 處理失敗 \n \n \n CMOS電池故障 \n \n \n \n \n CMOS電池故障 \n 蜂鳴碼比較表 \n 處理失敗 \n 5 \n \n \n \n \n BEEP CODE \n \n \n AMI \n \n \n DELL \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1 \n \n \n DRAM refresh failure \n \n \n BIOS ROM corruption or failure \n \n \n \n \n 2 \n \n \n Parity circuit failure \n \n \n RAM not detected \n \n \n \n \n 3 \n \n \n Base 64K RAM failure \n \n \n Motherboard failure \n \n \n \n \n 4 \n \n \n System timer failure \n \n \n RAM failure \n \n \n \n \n 5 \n \n \n Process failure \n \n \n CMOS battery failure \n \n \n \n \n CMOS battery failure \n 嗶聲的模式類似於摩斯密碼。 嗶聲的數量和順序具有電腦製造商設定的含義。 因此，每個嗶嗶聲的含義因製造商而異。 包含一些AMI和Dell嗶聲代碼的圖表如下所示。 \n Seven bits of original data, 1000010, are transmitted using odd parity. To determine the parity bit (the eighth bit of data), count the number of “1” bits in the data string. In this case, there are two “1” bits. Therefore the parity bit is set to 1, because the total number of “1” bits (two) in the data is even, which does not match the odd parity of the transmission. Because of the mismatch in the number of “1” bits and the parity setting (odd), the parity bit must be set to 1. Because the total number of “1” bits is two, adding a parity bit of “1” to the string will result in an odd number of “1” bits (three) in the full eight-bit string (seven data bits plus one parity bit). \n \n 111100000 is transmitted using even parity. To determine if the memory has been changed across the transmission, count the number of “1” bits in the data string, including the parity bit. In this case, there are four “1” bits. Because the total number of “1” bits (four) in the data is even, which matches the even parity of the transmission, no memory has been changed. \n \xa0 \n 10000100 is transmitted using odd parity. To determine if the memory has been changed across the transmission, count the number of “1” bits in the data string, including the parity bit. In this case, there are two “1” bits. The total number of “1” bits (two) in the data is even, which does not match the odd parity of the transmission. Therefore, memory has been changed. \n \n Here is a sample beep code from a computer having a problem: \n This beep code consists of two short beeps. What does this POST beep sequence mean? It depends on the BIOS’s manufacturer. \n Use a search engine to search for "AMI beep codes."\xa0 This might be a typical result. \xa0This website tells us that on an AMI computer, two short beeps indicate a memory parity error. \n Now search for "AST Research BIOS beep codes."\xa0 Here is a typical result. \xa0This website tells us that on an AST Research BIOS computer, two short beeps indicate a keyboard controller buffer failure. \n An Internet search for "IBM bios beep codes" would indicate that this beep code indicates a POST error, and that you should review the screen for the error code. \n Knowing the BIOS manufacturer is important when diagnosing a problem during the POST, as the meaning of the beep codes vary by manufacturer. \n 範例 \n 嗶聲代碼 \n 這是有問題的電腦發出的嗶嗶代碼範例： \n 此蜂鳴聲代碼包含兩個短蜂鳴聲。 這個POST嗶嗶聲序列是什麼意思？ 這取決於BIOS的製造商。 \n 使用搜尋引擎搜尋“ AMI蜂鳴聲代碼”。 這可能是典型的結果。 該網站告訴我們，在AMI計算機上，兩聲短促的嗶嗶聲表示內存奇偶校驗錯誤。 \n 現在搜尋“ AST Research BIOS嗶聲代碼”。 這是一個典型的結果。 該網站告訴我們，在AST Research BIOS計算機上，兩聲短促的嗶嗶聲表示鍵盤控制器緩衝區故障。 \n 如果在Internet上搜尋“ IBM bios嗶聲代碼”，則表明該嗶聲代碼指示POST錯誤，因此您應該在螢幕上查看錯誤代碼。 \n 在POST中診斷問題時，了解BIOS製造商很重要，因為嗶嗶代碼的含義因製造商而異。 \n So how is the BIOS updated? Recall that BIOS is firmware, or software on a chip. BIOS needs updating when there are power management issues or a processor is upgraded. Always check the manufacturer’s website for the latest firmware version. In the old systems (1980s-1990s), the actual BIOS chip had to be replaced entirely. In newer systems, the BIOS is “flashed.” Flashing is a special process in which the BIOS is overwritten, and shouldn’t be done unless absolutely necessary. Always be sure to back up information before doing a BIOS flash; if a flash doesn’t occur successfully, the system can be irrevocably broken to the point that it will no longer boot. \n \n 那麼如何更新BIOS？ 回想一下，BIOS是硬體或芯片上的軟體。 出現電源管理問題或升級處理器時，BIOS需要更新。 請經常在製造商的網站上查看最新硬體版本。 在舊系統（1980年代至1990年代）中，實際的BIOS芯片必須完全更換。 在較新的系統中，BIOS被“刷新”。 刷新是一個特殊的過程，其中BIOS被覆蓋，除非絕對必要，否則不應該這樣做。 經常確保在執行BIOS刷新之前備份信息； 如果無法成功進行刷新，則系統將無法恢復，甚至無法啟動。 \n EXAMPLE \n Eight bits of original data, 11110000, are transmitted using even parity. To determine the parity bit (the ninth bit of data), count the number of “1” bits in the data string. In this case, there are four “1” bits. Because the total number of “1” bits is four, the data is even. Therefore, the parity bit is set to 0. \n \n 奇偶校驗和ECC \n 奇偶校驗用於執行基本的錯誤檢查並確保記憶體內容可靠。此記憶體比非奇偶校驗慢，但增加了伺服器和某些桌上型電腦工作站所需的可靠性。 \n 奇偶校驗是一種檢測記憶體錯誤相當簡單的方法，沒有任何校正功能。奇偶校驗在添加到傳輸數據字符串的單個數據位中表示。如果模組通常具有七個數據位，則將八分之一添加為奇偶校驗位。如果模組通常有八個芯片用於數據，則添加第九個芯片以實現奇偶校驗。 \n 每個字節都有一個與之關聯的奇偶校驗位。在七位組成原始數據的情況下，總共傳輸了八位（七位原始數據位加一個奇偶校驗位）。在八位組成原始數據的情況下，總共傳輸九位（八位數據位加一位奇偶校驗位）。奇偶校驗位在寫入時設置，然後在讀取時進行計算和比較，以確定自存儲資料以來是否有任何位發生了更改。這種類型的檢查僅限於檢測單個位錯誤。如果更改了兩位，則將“通過”奇偶校驗，並且允許該錯誤可能損壞資料。 \n 奇偶校驗可以實現為“ 0”奇偶校驗或“ 1”奇偶校驗。存儲字節時，將加零（如果選擇了“ 1”奇偶校驗，則為零）的數目。結果存儲在奇偶校驗位中-如果為奇數，則為“ 1”；如果為偶數，則為“ 0”。從記憶體中讀取該字節後，將再次對這些位進行計數，並將結果與奇偶校驗位中存儲的結果進行比較。匹配表示資料從存儲時起就沒有改變（或以結果相同的方式更改了兩位）。 \n 不管發送的原始數據位數是多少，確定奇偶校驗位的過程都是相同的。通常，原始資料有七位或八位。 \n 奇偶校驗位是通過對數據字符串中“ 1”位的數量進行計數來確定的。 \n 使用奇偶校驗傳輸七位原始數據1000010。 要確定奇偶校驗位（數據的第八位），請計算數據字符串中“ 1”位的數量。 在這種情況下，有兩個“ 1”位。 因此，將奇偶校驗位設置為1，因為數據中“ 1”位（兩個）的總數為偶數，這與傳輸的奇數奇偶校驗不匹配。 由於“ 1”位的數量和奇偶校驗設置（奇數）不匹配，因此必須將奇偶校驗位設置為1。由於“ 1”位的總數為2，因此將奇偶校驗位“ 1”添加到 該字符串將在整個八位字符串（七個數據位加一個奇偶校驗位）中產生奇數個“ 1”位（三個）。 \n 使用偶校驗發送111100000。 要確定在傳輸過程中記憶體是否已被更改，請計算數據字符串中包括奇偶校驗位的“ 1”位數。 在這種情況下，有四個“ 1”位。 由於數據中的“ 1”位（四位）總數為偶數，與傳輸的偶數奇偶校驗相匹配，因此無任何記憶體被更改。 \n 使用奇偶校驗發送10000100。 要確定在傳輸過程中記憶體是否被更改，請計算數據字符串中包括奇偶校驗位的“ 1”位數。 在這種情況下，有兩個“ 1”位。 資料中“ 1”位的總數（兩個）是偶數，與傳輸的奇數奇偶校驗不匹配。 因此，記憶體已被更改。 \n Single-Sided and Double-Sided Memory \n Memory can be single-sided or double-sided. The benefit of double-sided modules is that a higher amount of storage can fit on a single chip and into a single slot. Some motherboards support double-sided SIMMs, but others do not, so it is important to check the motherboard’s manual for guidance. To determine if the module is double-sided, simply look at both sides. If chips are soldered on both sides, it is a double-sided SIMM. \n Memory can be single-sided or double-sided.

If chips are soldered on both sides, it is a double-sided SIMM. \n 單面和雙面記憶體 \n 記憶體可以是單面或雙面的。 雙面模組的好處在於，單個芯片和單個插槽中可以容納更多的存儲空間。 有些主機板支持雙面SIMM，而另一些則不支持，因此查看主機板的手冊以獲取指示很重要。 要確定模組是否雙面，只需查看一下雙面即可。 如果芯片的兩面都焊接，則為雙面SIMM。 \n 安裝記憶體的過程相當容易，但是必須謹慎且精確。 要安裝記憶體（或模組）： \n 1.始終確保採取適當的ESD（靜電釋放）保護措施，以確保在安裝過程中不會損壞主機板和記憶體模組。 \n 2.關閉電腦，然後拔下電源線。 \n 3.打開盒子，開始安裝記憶體。 始終將記憶體放在芯片的側面，而不要緊握金屬接點。 \n 4.將記憶體模組的連接器與主機板上的插槽對齊。 \n 5.確認鎖定卡榫處於打開位置。 \n 6.垂直向下推動模組，直到卡榫旋轉到鎖定位置（這需要用力）。 \n 重要說明：切勿觸摸模組上的金色接點！ 接點可能會腐蝕，或者由於靜電放電會損壞模塊。 \n 要了解有關如何安裝RAM的更多信息，請搜尋www.wikihow.com/Install-RAM。 \n Introduction to BIOS, CMOS, and Firmware \n When a computer is turned on, the computer’s microprocessor uses a program called the\xa0 BIOS \xa0(basic input/output system) to start the computer system. The BIOS also manages data flow between the computer\'s operating system and attached/connected devices, such as the hard drive, video adapter, keyboard, mouse, and printer. \n \n BIOS，CMOS和韌體簡介 \n 開啟電腦後，電腦的微處理器會使用稱為BIOS（基本輸入/輸出系統）的程序來啟動電腦系統。 BIOS還管理電腦操作系統和已連接/已連接的設備（例如硬碟、影像連接器、鍵盤、滑鼠和打印機）之間的資訊流。 \n The boot process: \n \n Power on computer. \n BIOS performs power-on self-test (POST). \n BIOS reads settings from CMOS. \n BIOS looks for operating system from configured boot device. \n \n \n Power on computer. \n BIOS performs power-on self-test (POST). \n BIOS reads settings from CMOS. \n BIOS looks for operating system from configured boot device. \n \n \n Power on computer. \n BIOS performs power-on self-test (POST). \n BIOS reads settings from CMOS. \n BIOS looks for operating system from configured boot device. \n \n 啟動過程： \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 1.開啟電腦電源。 \n \n BIOS執行開機自檢（POST）。 \n BIOS從CMOS讀取設定。 \n \n \n BIOS執行開機自檢（POST）。 \n BIOS從CMOS讀取設定。 \n \n \n BIOS執行開機自檢（POST）。 \n BIOS從CMOS讀取設定。 \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 4. BIOS從配置的啟動設備中尋找系統。 \n CMOS \n The CMOS (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor) is a battery-powered memory chip. It is nonvolatile memory that stores the BIOS settings and is built into the motherboard. As long as battery power remains, DC (direct current) is provided to the CMOS and allows the settings to be retained. If the computer is constantly losing the settings, the battery will need to be replaced. Older CMOS battery models used the DS12887A battery or AA-sized 3.6 volt Eternacell battery, and normally lasted approximately three years. Newer CMOS models include an internal lithium-ion battery that can last for up to 10 years. The most typical current external battery used is the CR2032, which resembles a standard watch battery. When the battery begins to fail, the first sign to the user is that the system clock frequently loses time. \n \n CMOS（互補金屬氧化物半導體）是電池供電的存儲芯片。 它是非易失性儲存器，用於儲存BIOS設置，並內置在主機板中。 只要電池還有電，就會向CMOS提供DC（直流電）並保留設定。 如果電腦不斷丟失設定，則需要更換電池。 較舊的CMOS電池型號使用DS12887A電池或AA尺寸的3.6伏Eternacell電池，通常可以使用大約三年。 較新的CMOS型號包括內置鋰離子電池，該電池可使用長達10年。 當前使用的最典型的外部電池是CR2032，它類似於標準的手錶電池。 當電池開始出現故障時，向用戶顯示的第一個信號是系統時鐘經常失準。 \n To change the settings in the CMOS, the user needs to enter the BIOS. To do this, the user must press a valid key or key combination during the boot process as set by the computer manufacturer. The most common keys used to enter the BIOS are F2 and/or Delete. Typically, the keystroke required to enter the BIOS is displayed on the monitor during the boot process. If the keystroke isn’t displayed, a quick search of the manufacturer’s website will often tell the user the required keystroke to enter the BIOS. \n \n The BIOS interface and the keystrokes to enter the BIOS change depending on the BIOS manufacturer. Below are images of the BIOS interface from two different manufacturers. Notice that while the information available is consistent between the two, the interface is slightly different. \n 要更改CMOS中的設定，用戶需要進入BIOS。 為此，用戶必須在電腦製造商設置的啟動過程中按下有效的按鍵或組合鍵。 用於進入BIOS的最常用的按鍵是F2和/或Delete。 通常，在啟動過程中，進入BIOS所需的按鍵將顯示在顯示器上。 如果未顯示按鍵，則搜尋製造商的網站通常會告訴用戶進入BIOS所使用的按鍵。 \n BIOS界面和用於進入BIOS的按鍵取決於BIOS製造商。 下面是來自兩個不同製造商的BIOS接口的圖像。 請注意，儘管兩者之間的可用訊息是一致的，但界面略有不同。 \n \n \n Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) \n Traditionally, there was only a single type of BIOS, which relied fully on text-based menus and the keyboard for input. More recently, most BIOS manufacturers have switched to the unified extensible firmware interface, or\xa0 UEFI . This updated BIOS allows for both keyboard and mouse input, and provides a\xa0 GUI\xa0 instead of the standard text-based menus; support for GUID partition tables ( GPT ) allowing access to disks up to 2 TB and backward compatibility to legacy partition structures (such as the master boot record ( MBR ) and Linux\'s GRand Unified Bootloader ( GRUB ); boot from removable media; a user interface allowing for online connectivity for web access, diagnostics, and file management; and\xa0 Secure Boot \xa0which protects pre-operating system code from modification. Some of these UEFI BIOS also include software that allows the user to surf the Internet, play basic games, and use backup programs without ever entering the normal operating system. \n \n 統一可擴展韌體接口（UEFI） \n BEEP CODE COMPARISON CHART \n Process failure \n RAM 故障 \n 系統計時器故障 \n 0101101 \n 0000000 1 \n 0000000 0 \n 0 \n Pch1 10、USB and PS/2 \n There are other variants of memory that have been used over the years, but they are not common today. The single inline memory module, or SIMM, has either 30 or 72 connectors on both sides of the chip. The single inline pin package, or SIPP, has only 30 pins, and they are physical pins instead of connectors. \n Dual inline memory module, or DIMM, is what is used for DDR, DDR2, and DDR3 chips, with each side of the module having different pinouts in the connectors. The SODIMM, small outline DIMM, is a compact version of memory used in laptops, notebooks, and printers. It can come in DDR SODIMM, DDR2 SODIMM, or DDR3 SODIMM. SODIMM is very common and still heavily used today. \n Finally, there is a laptop version of Rambus memory called small outline Rambus module, but it is rarely used in contemporary systems. \n \n 多年以來，內存還使用了其他變體，但今天並不常見。 單列直插式內存模組或SIMM在芯片的兩側都有30或72個連接器。 單列直插式引腳封裝或SIPP只有30個針腳，它們是物理針腳而不是連接器。 \n DDR，DDR2和DDR3芯片使用雙列直插式內存模組或DIMM，模塊的每一側在連接器中具有不同的針腳排列。 SODIMM是小型DIMM，是便攜式電腦，筆記本電腦和打印機中使用的緊湊型記憶體。 它可以採用DDR SODIMM，DDR2 SODIMM或DDR3 SODIMM。 SODIMM非常普遍，今天仍然大量使用。 \n 最後，有一個筆記本電腦版本的Rambus存儲器，稱為小型Rambus模組，但在現代系統中很少使用 \n Memory Module Width \n Memory module width is measured by the number of bits that can be transferred. Memory began in 8-bit varieties, but has increased to 16 bits, 32 bits, and now 64 bits in current systems. Memory must be added in banks to ensure the width equals the width of the memory bus. For example, if you need 64 bits and a single module offers 64 bits, then it will have one module in the bank. Dual-channel memory requires double the amount, therefore two 64-bit (128 bit) DIMMs are needed in the banks, while three are required for triple-channel, as was mentioned earlier. \n \n 記憶體模組寬度 \n 記憶體模組的寬度由可傳輸的位數決定。 內存最初以8位形式出現，但在當前系統中已增加到16位，32位和現在的64位。 必須以存儲體的形式添加內存，以確保其寬度等於記憶體總線的寬度。 例如，如果您需要64位，而單個模組提供64位，則庫中將只有一個模組。 如前所述，雙通道內存需要兩倍的存儲量，因此存儲庫中需要兩個64位（128位）DIMM，而三通道則需要三個。 \n Parity and ECC \n Parity is used to perform basic error checking and to ensure the memory contents are reliable. This memory is slower than non-parity, but adds the reliability needed for servers and certain desktop workstations. \n Parity checking is a rather simple method of detecting memory errors, without any correction capabilities. Parity is signified in a single bit of data that is added to the transmitted data string. If the module normally would have seven bits of data, an eighth is added as the parity bit. If the module normally would have eight chips for data, a ninth chip is added for parity. \n Every byte has a parity bit associated with it. In the case that seven bits make up the original data, there are eight total bits transmitted (seven original data bits plus one parity bit). In the case that eight bits make up the original data, a total of nine bits are transmitted (eight data bits plus one parity bit). The parity bit is set at write time, and then calculated and compared at read time to determine if any of the bits have changed since the data was stored. This type of checking is limited to detection of single bit errors. If two bits have been altered, the parity check will “pass,” and the error is allowed to possibly corrupt the data. \n Parity checking can be implemented either as “0” parity or “1” parity. When the byte is stored, the number of zeros (or ones, if “1” parity is selected) is added up. The result is stored in the parity bit – “1” if odd, “0” if even. When that byte is read from memory, the bits are again counted and the result is compared against what was stored in the parity bit. A match means that the data was not changed from when it was stored (or that two bits were altered in such a way that the result is the same). \n The process to determine the parity bit is the same, regardless of the number of original data bits transmitted. Typically, there are either seven or eight bits of original data. \n The parity bit is determined by counting the number of “1” bits in a data string. \n \n \n \n \n \n Set parity bit to: \n \n \n \n \n \n Even parity \n \n \n Odd parity \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Even number of “1” bits \n \n \n 0 \n \n \n 1 \n \n \n \n \n Odd number of “1” bits \n \n \n 1 \n \n \n 0 \n \n \n \n \n Even number of “1” bits \n Odd parity \n Even parity \n Set parity bit to: \n \n \n \n \n \n Set parity bit to: \n \n \n \n \n \n Even parity \n \n \n Odd parity \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Even number of “1” bits \n \n \n 0 \n \n \n 1 \n \n \n \n \n Odd number of “1” bits \n \n \n 1 \n \n \n 0 \n \n \n \n \n Set parity bit to: \n Even parity \n Odd parity \n Even number of “1” bits \n 0000000 \n 奇校驗 \n 偶校驗 \n 傳輸的位元（8 位或9 位，取決於原始位元的數量），包括奇偶校驗 \n “ 1 ”位的計數 \n 原始資料 \n \n \n \n \n 原始資料 \n \n \n “ 1 ”位的計數 \n \n \n 傳輸的位元（8 位或9 位，取決於原始位元的數量），包括奇偶校驗 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 偶校驗 \n \n \n 奇校驗 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 0000000 \n \n \n 0 \n \n \n 0000000 0 \n \n \n 0000000 1 \n \n \n \n \n 0101101 \n \n \n 4 \n \n \n 0101101 0 \n \n \n 0101101 1 \n \n \n \n \n 0101010 \n \n \n 3 \n \n \n 0101010 1 \n \n \n 0101010 0 \n \n \n \n \n 10000000 \n \n \n 1 \n \n \n 1000000 1 \n \n \n 10000000 0 \n \n \n \n \n 11111100 \n \n \n 6 \n \n \n 11111100 0 \n \n \n 11111100 1 \n \n \n \n \n 10001100 \n \n \n 3 \n \n \n 10001100 1 \n \n \n 10001100 0 \n \n \n \n \n 原始資料 \n “ 1 ”位的計數 \n 傳輸的位元（8 位或9 位，取決於原始位元的數量），包括奇偶校驗 \n 偶校驗 \n 奇校驗 \n 0000000 \n Pch1 1、Introduction \n \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \n 原文: This lesson will cover the basics of PC\xa0 Hardware. \xa0First, you will learn the various parts of both desktop and laptop\xa0 computers. \xa0Next, you will discover basic terms that are associated with computers, such as hardware, software, and\xa0 firmware. \xa0You will learn the most basic functions of a computer: input, output, storage, and\xa0 processing. \xa0Next, you will explore various input and output interfaces on the computer and the associated\xa0 cables. \xa0Finally, you will review connections between common peripherals and discuss the standard\xa0 ports. \n 原文:This lesson will cover the basics of PC\xa0 Hardware. \xa0First, you will learn the various parts of both desktop and laptop\xa0 computers. \xa0Next, you will discover basic terms that are associated with computers, such as hardware, software, and\xa0 firmware. \xa0You will learn the most basic functions of a computer: input, output, storage, and\xa0 processing. \xa0Next, you will explore various input and output interfaces on the computer and the associated\xa0 cables. \xa0Finally, you will review connections between common peripherals and discuss the standard\xa0 ports. \n \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0\xa0 \n 翻譯:本課將介紹硬 體 的基礎知識。首先，您將學習台式計算機和攜帶式計算機的各個部分。接下來，您將發現與計算機關聯的基本術語，例如 硬體，軟體和韌體 。您將學習計算機的最 基本功能：輸入，輸出，存儲和處理 。接下來，您將探索計算機上的 各種輸入和輸出接口以及相關的電纜 。最後，您將回顧通用外設之間的連接並討論標準端口。 \xa0 \n So, as we consider the history of computers and the future of computers, we must consider what is and what is not a computer.

To build a computer, we must first gather the required hardware. The hardware is the part of the computer that you can touch and feel. When most people see a typical computer, they understand that there are physical components to what they are using, such as the the hard metallic or plastic System unit, central processing unit (CPU), power supply, disk drives, and other essential components. Hardware is limited by its manufacture date and specifically by the motherboard installed. Depending on age and availability, some of the hardware items may be expensive to acquire, repair, or replace. For example, if the computer is running slower over time as you add newer software, it may be necessary to increase the amount of physical memory, called\xa0 RAM\xa0 (random access memory), in the computer. In order to do this, the technician would need to purchase the correct size, speed, and style of memory according to the motherboard specifications and install it in the computer which will then enhance its ability to process information more quickly. \n Computer hardware consists of the mechanical and electrical parts of the computer. Data flows through the motherboard in what is known as the system bus. External ports, which are discussed in more detail further in this lesson, allow peripheral devices to be connected to the system unit. Common ports are USB, serial, and parallel ports. \n Peripheral devices consist of hardware attached to the system unit and are designated as input, output, or both. Traditional input device examples are the mouse and keyboard which are used to input data. \n \n \n Traditionally singular devices have evolved to become both input and output. Gaming Joysticks which provide feedback to the user through vibrations and of course the touch-screen display now serve as both. \n Output devices consist of common items such as monitors, speakers, and printers.

These programs are used to create, store, modify, and view information that you create. Applications, such as Microsoft Office or Adobe Acrobat, allow you to read and create documents and presentations. Other applications, such as games and web browsers, may instead be used for entertainment. \n The most basic software that a computer requires is the operating system. There are numerous operating systems on the market today, including various versions of Microsoft Windows, Macintosh OS X, Linux, Android, and iOS, to name just a few. The operating system provides the standard methods for saving, retrieving, changing, printing, and transmitting information in the computer. Operating systems contain internal commands, which are programs that are built into the operating system to perform basic tasks such as file management (delete, copy, and rename files). Additionally, operating systems also contain external commands, which are added programs to complete more complicated functions, such as defragmentation of a hard drive or handling the remote control of another computer on the network. \n 原文:Software is completely intangible and cannot be physically touched. Software, in its purest form, is a series of 1s and 0s (bits) that make up the code that gives the computer its instructions on how to perform a certain task. While you may be able to touch the media on which the software is stored (like a CD or DVD), you cannot really touch the software code itself. \n The most basic software that a computer requires is the operating system.

Other applications, such as games and web browsers, may instead be used for entertainment. \n Pch1\xa0 5、Firmware \n \n 原文:Firmware is a combination of hardware and software, often called “software on a chip.” Firmware allows control of the device to which the chip is connected. A firmware chip contains specialized software and is often attached to motherboards, optical drives (such as CD, DVD, or Blu-ray), mass storage devices, and other specialized hardware. \n In older generations of firmware, the firmware was not upgradable unless you replaced the physical chip, but in recent years firmware has been designed to be “flashable.” This means that the chip can be upgraded if the software is outdated or has a programming error. This firmware “flash” replaces the older software on the chip with the latest version, improving performance or enhancing security. \n The most common type of firmware found in a computer is called the BIOS (basic input/output system), which provides the computer with the most basic of tasks before the operating system is even loaded. Without the BIOS, the computer would be rather useless, as it wouldn’t even be able to read the hard drive and load the operating system. Firmware is persistent: it remains on the chip even after the power is removed, unlike temporary storage (such as RAM). \n 翻譯: \n 韌體是硬體和軟體的組合 ，通常稱為“晶片上的軟體”。韌體允許控制芯片所連接的設備。韌體晶片包含專用軟體，通常連接到主板，光碟驅動器（例如CD，DVD或藍光），大容量存儲設備和其他專用硬 體 。 \n 在較早版本的韌體中，除非更換了物理芯片，否則韌體無法升級，但是近年來，韌體被設計為“可刷新的”。 這意味著，如果軟體過時或出現編程錯誤，則可以升級芯片。 韌體 “閃存”用最新版本替換了芯片上的舊軟體，從而提高了性能或增強了安全性。 \n 計算機中最常見的 韌體類型稱為BIOS（基本輸入/輸出系統） ，BIOS甚至在加載操作系統之前就為計算機提供了最基本的任務。 沒有BIOS，計算機將變得毫無用處，因為它甚至無法讀取硬盤驅動器並加載操作系統。 韌體 具有持久性：與臨時存儲（例如RAM）不同，韌體即使在斷電後仍保留在芯片上。 \n Pch1\xa0 6、Componentization Standardization \n \n 原文:Componentization is the process of breaking down large and complex items into simple, reusable, and interchangeable pieces. For many years, computer software and hardware were made by individual companies building things that only worked for a single system. For example, if IBM made a network card, it would not work in a Compaq or Dell computer. Over the years, hardware developers realized that if they could agree to a set of standards, they could create components that could be built to work together using standard interfaces, which saves time, money, and complexity. This same concept is now being used in the software world under object-oriented programming — a standardized method of programming. \n Standardization allows for a set of rules that everyone can follow so that hardware is interoperable and software is interoperable. This increases the ability to have componentization of hardware and software, since the input and output created are standardized. For example, web pages are coded in HTML (HyperText Markup Language), which all web browsers understand. Therefore, the user can use any web browser and still get the content they are interested in viewing because of the standardization of the system. \n 翻譯: 組件 化是將大型和復雜項目分解為簡單，可重用和可互換的部分的過程。 多年來，計算機軟件和硬件是由獨立的公司製造的，這些公司只能在單個系統上工作。例如，如果IBM製作了網卡，則它不能在Compaq或Dell計算機中工作。多年以來，硬件開發人員意識到，如果他們同意一套標準，他們可以創建可以使用標準接口構建為可以協同工作的組件，從而節省了時間，金錢和復雜性。現在，在面向對象的程序設計（一種標準化的程序設計方法）下的軟件世界中使用了相同的概念。 \n 標準化允許每個人都可以遵循一組規則，以便硬件可互操作，軟件可互操作。 由於創建的輸入和輸出是標準化的，因此這提高了對硬件和軟件進行組件化的能力。 例如，網頁以HTML（超文本標記語言）編碼，所有網絡瀏覽器都可以理解。 因此，由於系統的標準化，用戶可以使用任何Web瀏覽器，並且仍然可以獲得他們感興趣的內容。 \n Pch1 7、 Connection Interfaces and Cables \n \n 原文:When looking at a customer’s personal computer, you must be able to easily identify the various components that make up the computer by sight. As you look at the image of the computer, you notice the various parts, such as the CD/DVD drive and the memory card reader bay. Both of these components would be classified as part of the storage subsystem. The headphone jack is used for audio output, while the microphone jack is used for audio input. The USB and FireWire ports are used for both input and output, as well as storage, depending on the device that is connected to the port. For example, if we connect a printer to the USB port, it would be used for output, but if we instead connected a mouse to the USB port, it would be used for input. \n 翻譯: 查看客戶的個人計算機時，您必須能夠通過視線輕鬆識別組成計算機的各種組件。 當您查看計算機的圖像時，會注意到各個部分，例如CD / DVD驅動器和存儲卡讀取器托架。 這兩個組件都將歸類為存儲子系統的一部分。 耳機插孔用於音頻輸出，而麥克風插孔用於音頻輸入。 USB和FireWire端口用於輸入和輸出以及存儲，具體取決於連接到端口的設備。 例如，如果我們將打印機連接到USB端口，它將用於輸出，但是如果我們將鼠標連接到USB端口，則它將用於輸入。 \n Pch1 8、 External Components of the Desktop System Unit \n \n 原文:The lab activity below is designed to help you locate and understand the purpose of the various bays and ports on a desktop PC system unit.

Ports allow for information to flow into or out of the computer as part of the input and output subsystems. External devices, such as keyboards, mice, printers, scanners, storage devices, monitors, and others can connect to the computer through various types of cables, which connect to specific ports. On most modern systems, this has been reduced down to a common, standard interface, the universal serial bus port (USB port). Older systems have various ports for various functions, which are now referred to as legacy ports, such as PS/2, serial, and parallel ports. They were difficult to configure and required hardware resources to be dedicated to them, such as interrupt requests, direct memory access, and specific I/O (input/output) port addresses. In USB, this is all handled by the operating system automatically. This makes hardware conflicts rare in current systems. Many customers will still have computers with legacy ports. So, it is important to understand multiple ports and connections. \n Pch1 9、 Connections Between Common Peripherals and Standard Ports \n The peripherals connect to the computer via standard ports.

Listen to the hard drive; do you hear a mechanical clicking sound? If you do, your hard drive is likely failing and should be replaced as soon as possible. If you do not hear any clicking noises, there might be bad sectors on the disk, so perform disk maintenance procedures, such as “check disk” (CHKDSK) or “disk defragmentation” (DISK DEFRAG). \n If the laptop display did turn on, then you need to see if the operating system boots. If it does not boot, it could be a data corruption issue or a hard drive failure. First, try booting the laptop from the AC adapter instead of the battery. Did that work? If so, it may be that the battery isn’t providing enough power to spin the hard drive properly. If that does not work, next, check the BIOS to see if the hard drive is being recognized. If the drive is not recognized in the BIOS, check the physical connections (power and data cables, like IDE/PATA and SATA). If the hard drive is recognized in the BIOS, but the operating system does not boot, it could be that the data on the drive has become corrupted; therefore, the operating system may need to be reinstalled and the user data may need to be restored from backup. \n To determine if a laptop hard drive has failed, you must follow a logical troubleshooting methodology. First, attempt to boot up the computer. If you cannot see the display working, then listen for the hard disk. Did you hear it “spin up” when you powered on the machine? If not, it is likely a laptop power issue and not a hard drive issue. Check the battery and the AC adapter to ensure the laptop is receiving power. \n Other issues with hard drives include data becoming corrupted or invalid due to virus infection or attacks, abnormal system shutdown, accidental cancellation of a running program, frequent power failure, and many other causes. These are not issues solely in laptops; these problems can occur with both laptop and desktop models. \n Mechanical failures and defects are another possible cause of hard drive failure in laptops and notebooks. Bad sectors in the hard disk, the motor’s failure to perform rotation, power supply issues, and many other issues can cause hard drive failures. An old hard disk may create problems, or mechanical failure can occur if you have formatted the hard disk too many times. Normally, you can hear a mechanical failure — there may be a clicking sound coming from the disk, or you will hear the disk fail to “spin up” when powered on. \n Hard drive failures are fairly uncommon occurrences for computers overall, but in laptops they have a higher occurrence rate than in desktops. Usually, this occurs when something jars the laptop while the hard disk is working. Another cause of hard drive failure is an overheated hard drive. The hard drive, like other devices in the computer, requires adequate cooling to ensure proper operation. If the hard drive overheats, you need to check to see if the laptop is receiving adequate cooling. You can do this by making sure the air intake and fans are working properly and are not filled with dust. \n \xa0 \n Installing Memory Modules \n Installing memory is a common computer upgrade and a very easy task to perform. Memory modules are installed as “sticks” (or modules) of memory into the “slots” on the motherboard. \n \n 安裝記憶體模組 \n 安裝記憶體是電腦的常見升級，並且是很容易執行的。 記憶體模組作為記憶體的“棒”（或模組）安裝在主板上的“插槽”中。 \n 範例 \n 使用偶校驗發送八位原始數據11110000。 要確定奇偶校驗位（數據的第9位），請計算數據字符串中“ 1”位的數量。 在這種情況下，有四個“ 1”位。 因為“ 1”位的總數是四，所以數據是偶數。 因此，奇偶校驗位設置為0。 \n Pch1 10、USB and PS/2 \n \n 原文1: \n \n USB cables should be kept under three meters (approximately nine feet) in length for USB 1.1 and 3.0. For the USB 2.0 variant, you can use cables up to five meters (approximately 15 feet) without issues. If you use cables longer than the recommended length, you may get errors in your input/output over USB, so it is best to keep the USB cables short. If you need a longer cable run, you must use a hub as a repeater to help boost the power signal over the USB cable. There are two types of hubs: self-powered and bus-powered. Self-powered hubs have their own power adapter and connect to the wall outlet to provide power to the hub. Bus-powered are instead powered solely from the source USB port that they are connected to on the computer. This provides minimal amperage for the devices connected to the USB hub that can cause issues when connecting multiple hubs to each other. For connection of multiple hubs, it is best practice to use self-powered hubs. Each USB port can support up to 127 different devices in the chain, with the root hub for the computer having two ports directly connected to the motherboard. If you need more USB ports, you can do this by adding hubs (self-powered or bus-powered), using motherboard USB header cables, or adding expansion cards that contain more USB ports. \n Things such as mice and keyboards, which used to use PS/2 or serial ports, now use USB. Things like printers and scanners, which once used parallel or SCSI ports, now use USB as well. Small computer system interface (SCSI) is a set of parallel interface standards developed by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) for attaching printers, disk drives, scanners and other peripherals to computers. SCSI (pronounced "skuzzy") is supported by all major operating systems. USB began with version 1.1, which provided two speeds of operations: low-speed (1.5 Mbps for input devices such as mice/keyboards) and full-speed (12 Mbps for other devices, such as webcams, digital cameras, scanners, and printers). USB 2.0 further increased speed to what is known as high-speed or hi-speed (480 Mbps), allowing for USB to provide faster access to external storage devices such as hard drives, helping to replace SCSI and FireWire ports. USB 3.0, the current version, is known as superspeed, because it provides up to 5 Gbps of bandwidth for very fast access to external devices and can be identified by the blue color. Newer versions of USB are backward compatible with older versions, but you should not connect different versions of USB on the same port, as this slows the port down to the lowest version. For example, if you plug in a four-port USB hub to a USB 3.0 port, but then connect a USB 1.1 mouse to the hub, the entire four-port hub will now run at a maximum speed of 12 Mbps (USB 1.1 speeds). Each USB port can be daisy-chained to provide up to 127 devices per port, using USB hubs. \n USB\xa0:The\xa0 universal serial bus (USB)\xa0 has replaced many of the external input and output ports on modern computers.

If your computer doesn’t have a serial port (which is very common in modern machines), you can add one using an expansion card or a USB to serial adapter. Serial ports come in two varieties: DB-25 (containing 25 pins) and DB-9 (containing nine pins). The DB-9 variety is the most common in use. Serial ports are generally slow, since they send data one bit at a time over the wire. There is no standard serial cable pinout; instead, they are created for the application they are used for, such as a null-modem cable to connect two computers directly, or a modem cable to connect the computer to an external modem. The most common variety of serial cable in use today is the CISCO rollover cable, which has a nine-pin serial port on one end and an RJ-45 connector (like a network cable) on the other end. This cable is used to connect a computer to a CISCO router or switch for configuration tasks. \n Serial ports :Serial ports, also known as COM or RS-232 ports, were used heavily in the 1980s and 1990s for serial communication as input/output ports.

They were often used for printers and scanners. USB has replaced parallel ports for all of these uses in modern computers, and few people will still have a need for a parallel port in contemporary computing. If your computer doesn’t have a parallel port (which is very common in modern machines), you could add one using an expansion card or a USB to parallel adapter. Parallel ports come in a standard DB-25 (containing 25 pins) cable. Other varieties of cables exist, including a DB-25 to Centronics 36-pin cable (common with printers), DB-25 to DB-25 cable (common with switchboxes), and DB-25 to DB-25 with the transmit/receive pins reversed (common for computer to computer connections for data transfer). Parallel ports are generally faster than serial ports, since they send data in parallel with eight bits at a time going over the wire. Parallel ports can be configured as output only or bidirectional ports. The ports are also configured as EPP (enhanced parallel port), ECP (enhanced capabilities port), and EPP/ECP. Under EPP, the port uses interrupt request (IRQ) and I/O addresses for fastest speeds. In ECP, the port can support daisy-chaining of devices and uses IRQ, I/O address, and DMA channels, and is considered resource hungry. EPP/ECP combines both modes into a single configuration, allowing for maximum compatibility. Parallel ports transmit data at up to two Mbps and receive data at 500 Kbps, which is very slow by today’s standards. \n Parallel ports : Parallel ports, also known as LPT (line printer terminal) ports, were used heavily in the 1980s and 1990s for parallel communication as input/output ports.

The first laptops were created in the 1970s, but only for very specialized uses. Widespread adoption of laptop computers did not occur until the 1990s, but today they are in use everywhere. Originally, there were distinctions between laptops, notebooks, and netbooks, but in our discussions the terms will be used interchangeably. The distinctions between laptops, notebooks, and netbooks can most often be attributed to marketing, and many of those differences have morphed as the industry continues to evolve. Laptops and notebooks have essentially become a reference to fully equipped mobile computers with hardware and software availability similar to standard desktops using full-instruction set processors (x86 or x64). Most netbooks and tablets generally use embedded processors, such as arm-based RISC or similar. For example, an Alienware R-18 or an HP Elite series laptop runs a full operating system and can support any software designed for a desktop PC. Apple Macbook Pro and Air laptops also run desktop-equivalent, full operating systems. Classifications for a laptop might include desktop replacement, gaming rig, multimedia, or business class. Notebooks, as a subset of laptops, can be further classified as business class, ultrabook, or ultra-portable. Generally, the biggest differences between laptops and notebooks are the physical dimensions and weight. \n While most laptops and notebooks may share similar processor design and software with their desktop counterparts, netbooks and tablets are quite different, because netbooks and tablets use ARM or MIPS RISC processors. In netbooks and tablets expandability is usually limited to an external USB port and micro-SD card reader. Netbook as a name is increasingly being replaced with "Chromebook", which is available from most major computer manufacturers. The OS and software available is limited and specialized for these processors. Current models include the Android and Windows RT operating systems. With the power of cloud computing and software as a service (SaaS), netbooks and tablets are more enticing for users because of their lower cost, lightweight nature, and longer battery life. We will discuss tablets separately as a “mobile device” in another module. \n Laptops are regular computers and are fully capable of completing all of the same functions as a desktop workstation. As stated above, the main difference is their portability and size. The main difference is their size: they are much smaller and more compact than a traditional workstation. For this reason, they are limited in their internal component replacement, upgrades, and expansion, and these upgrades are performed differently than in a traditional computer workstation. The main differences between laptops, notebooks, and netbooks are their size and the amount of processing power and capabilities they have. Laptops tend to have more internal storage, video capabilities, and processing power than the smaller netbooks. Because laptops and notebooks are smaller than their desktop counterparts, most laptops compromise on power to allow for mobility and smaller size. The compact size of these devices reduces their ability to provide cooling. Therefore, processing power is often sacrificed to minimize heat and maximize battery life. \n In spite of these limitations for most laptops, most all manufacturers offer models with top of the line mobile processors, discrete graphics cards, improved cooling, and a comparable amount of RAM (currently up to 32 GB). With this kind of processing power and speed, laptops users may experience less than average battery life. \n The most common type of memory used in laptop computers is the small outline dual in-line memory module (SODIMM). SODIMM is a good option for laptop computers, as it takes up a fraction of the space the dual in-line memory module (DIMM) of a typical desktop computer does. \n \n 翻譯: \n 筆記型電腦，上網本和筆記型電腦是專門為移動用途而設計的計算機 ，與保持靜止的標準台式機工作站不同。第一台筆記型電腦創建於1970年代，但僅用於非常專業的用途。直到1990年代，筆記型電腦才被廣泛採用，但是今天它們在世界各地都得到了使用。最初，筆記型電腦，筆記型電腦和上網本之間存在區別，但是在我們的討論中，這些術語可以互換使用。筆記型電腦，筆記型電腦和上網本之間的區別通常可以歸因於市場營銷，並且隨著行業的不斷發展，這些差異中的許多差異都在變化。筆記型電腦和筆記型電腦實質上已成為具有硬件和軟件可用性的功能齊全的移動計算機的參考，類似於使用全指令集處理器（x86或x64）的標準台式機。大多數上網本和平板電腦通常使用嵌入式處理器，例如基於Arm的RISC或類似處理器。例如，Alienware R-18或HP Elite系列筆記型電腦運行完整的操作系統，並且可以支持為台式PC設計的任何軟件。Apple Macbook Pro和Air筆記型電腦還運行與台式機等效的完整操作系統。筆記型電腦的分類可能包括台式機更換，遊戲機，多媒體或商務艙。筆記型電腦，作為筆記型電腦的子集，可以進一步分為商務類，超級本或超便攜式。通常，筆記型電腦和筆記型電腦之間的最大區別是物理尺寸和重量。 \n 儘管大多數筆記型電腦和筆記型電腦可能與台式機共享相似的處理器設計和軟件， 但上網本和平板電腦卻大不相同，因為上網本和平板電腦使用ARM或MIPS RISC處理器。 在上網本和平板電腦中，可擴展性通常僅限於外部USB端口和micro-SD讀卡器。 上網本的名稱正越來越多地由大多數主要計算機製造商提供的“ Chromebook”代替。 可用的OS和軟件受限制並且專門針對這些處理器。 當前的模型包括Android和Windows RT操作系統。 借助雲計算和軟件即服務（SaaS）的強大功能， 上網本和平板電腦具有較低的成本，輕巧的特性和更長的電池壽命，因此對用戶更具吸引力。 我們將在另一個模塊中將平板電腦作為“移動設備”進行單獨討論。 \n 筆記型電腦是普通計算機，完全能夠完成與台式機工作站相同的所有功能。 如上所述，主要區別在於它們的可移植性和大小。 它們的主要區別在於它們的大小：它們比傳統的工作站小得多，而且更緊湊。 因此，它們在內部組件更換，升級和擴展方面受到限制，並且這些升級的執行方式與傳統計算機工作站不同。 筆記型電腦，筆記型電腦和上網本之間的主要區別在於它們的大小以及它們具有的處理能力和功能量。 筆記型電腦往往比較小的上網本具有更多的內部存儲，視頻功能和處理能力。 由於筆記型電腦和筆記型電腦的尺寸小於台式機，大多數筆記型電腦會在功耗上有所妥協，以實現移動性和更小的尺寸。這些設備的緊湊尺寸降低了它們提供冷卻的能力。因此，通常犧牲處理能力以最小化熱量並最大化電池壽命。 \n 儘管大多數筆記型電腦都有這些限制，但大多數所有製造商都提供配備頂級移動處理器，獨立顯卡，改進的散熱和相當數量的RAM（當前最高32 GB）的型號。 通過這種處理能力和速度，筆記型電腦用戶可能會遇到比平均電池壽命短的情況。 \n 便攜式計算機中最常用的內存類型是小型雙列直插式內存模塊（SODIMM）。SODIMM對於便攜式計算機來說是一個不錯的選擇，因為它僅佔台式計算機雙列直插式內存模塊（DIMM）的一小部分。 \n \n Pch 17、2 Installing and Configuring Laptop Hardware \n 原文:The first method that was developed to expand a laptop’s capabilities was the Personal Computer Memory Card International Association (PCMCIA) card. These cards were inserted into an expansion slot on the slide of the laptop and fit almost completely inside the casing of the machine. These cards originally came as PC cards (16-bit or 32-bit) or CardBus (32-bit) cards that fit into the associated slot. These cards were hot-swappable, meaning that the card could be ejected or inserted while the computer was still powered on. The idea of these cards was to provide a standard expansion port, similar to a PCI expansion slot on a traditional desktop computer. These cards had 68 pins in a two-row connector. These cards came in three types: type I, type II, and type III. Type I was used to provide additional memory and storage capabilities, but is now obsolete. Type II was used to provide additional input/output connections (like FireWire or USB), a network interface card, modem, or other such external devices/connectivity. Type II cards were only 5 mm thick, so they usually had to include a dongle to convert a flat proprietary connection to a standard connection like FireWire, RJ-45, or RJ-11. Type III was used as an upgraded version of the type II device and was thicker, reaching 10.5 mm in size, reducing or eliminating the need for a dongle. Cardbus, an improvement to the PC card, was a full 32-bit expansion card system and operated very similarly to the PC card. The CardBus was easily identified by looking at the edge of the expansion card, since it contained a golden edge where the connectors were. \n 翻譯: 擴展筆記記型電腦功能的第一種方法是國際個人計算機存儲卡協會（PCMCIA）卡。 這些卡已插入筆記型電腦滑軌上的擴展槽中，幾乎完全可以裝入計算機機箱內。 這些卡最初是作為可插入相關插槽的PC卡（16位或32位）或CardBus（32位）卡來的 。 這些卡是可熱插拔的，這意味著可以在計算機仍打開電源時彈出或插入卡。 這些卡的想法是提供一個標準擴展端口，類似於傳統台式計算機上的PCI擴展插槽 。 這些卡在兩行連接器中有68個引腳。 這些卡分為三種類型：I型，II型和III型。 類型I用於提供其他內存和存儲功能，但現在已過時。 類型II用於提供其他輸入/輸出連接（如FireWire或USB），網絡接口卡，調製解調器或其他此類外部設備/連接性。 II型卡只有5毫米厚，因此它們通常必須包含一個加密狗才能將扁平的專有連接轉換為FireWire，RJ-45或RJ-11等標準連接。 III型用作II型設備的升級版，它更厚，達到10.5毫米，從而減少或消除了對加密狗的需求。 Cardbus是PC卡的改進 ，它是一個完整的32位擴展卡系統，其操作與PC卡非常相似。 通過查看擴展卡的邊緣，可以輕鬆識別CardBus，因為它包含連接器所在的金色邊緣。 \n \n Pch 17 3、Notebook Features \n 原文: \n By pressing the FN key in combination with the notebook specific keys\xa0 the user can access features such as increasing or decreasing screen brightness, toggling Wi-Fi and Bluetooth radios on and off, cycling through external monitor connections, adjusting the speaker volume, and other features depending on the specific laptop. Note in the image above that some of the letter and character keys have numbers written on them. That is because most laptops do not have room for a dedicated number pad and these keys provide that functionality when pressing the FN and NUM LOCK combination. If you are typing and notice numbers on the screen instead of letters, it may be the result of accidentally pressing that key sequence. \n Another special feature of a laptop is the ability to connect an external monitor. Most desktop computers come standard with a single video output, whereas most laptops come with an external video port using HDMI, DisplayPort, DVI, or VGA. This allows you to duplicate, or extend, the internal display to the monitor to create a single continuous “larger” monitor. This is also advantageous when connecting a projector to the external port for presentations. \n 翻譯: \n 通過同時按下FN鍵和筆記本專用鍵，用戶可以使用以下功能 ：增加或降低屏幕亮度，打開和關閉Wi-Fi和藍牙無線電，通過外部顯示器連接循環，調整揚聲器的音量以及其他功能，具體取決於特定的筆記本電腦。請注意，在上圖中，某些字母和字符鍵上面寫有數字。這是因為大多數筆記本電腦沒有足夠的空間容納專用數字鍵盤，並且在按下FN和NUM LOCK組合鍵時，這些鍵可提供該功能。如果您在屏幕上鍵入並註意數字而不是字母，則可能是由於不小心按下該鍵序列而導致的。 \n 筆記本電腦的另一個特殊功能是可以連接外部顯示器。大多數台式機標配單個視頻輸出，而大多數筆記本電腦均帶有使用HDMI，DisplayPort，DVI或VGA的外部視頻端口。 這使您可以將內部顯示複製或擴展到監視器，以創建單個連續的“較大”監視器。 將投影儀連接到外部端口進行演示時，這也是有利的。 \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': 'Pch 17.html'}, {'title': '40923244鄭宇佑-1', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': '40923244鄭宇佑-1.html'}, {'title': '40923249戴揚哲-1', 'text': '\n \n \n \n \n \n', 'tags': '', 'url': '40923249戴揚哲-1.html'}, {'title': 'HW2', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': 'HW2.html'}, {'title': 'HW3', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': 'HW3.html'}, {'title': '40923203陳宥歆-2', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': '40923203陳宥歆-2.html'}, {'title': '40923208葉媛婷-2', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': '40923208葉媛婷-2.html'}, {'title': '40923209盧詩婷-2', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': '40923209盧詩婷-2.html'}, {'title': '40923210羅諭琳', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': '40923210羅諭琳.html'}, {'title': '40923223游尚霖-2', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': '40923223游尚霖-2.html'}, {'title': '40923225黃亦銘-2', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': '40923225黃亦銘-2.html'}, {'title': '40923230黃暐哲-3', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': '40923230黃暐哲-3.html'}, {'title': '40923238鄒杰-2', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': '40923238鄒杰-2.html'}, {'title': '40923239蔡育嘉-2', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': '40923239蔡育嘉-2.html'}, {'title': '40923244鄭宇佑-2', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': '40923244鄭宇佑-2.html'}, {'title': '40923249戴揚哲-2', 'text': '', 'tags': '', 'url': '40923249戴揚哲-2.html'}]};
